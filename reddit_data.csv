This mesocycle I noticed my body was giving me signs that it may be needing a deload earlier then I programmed. I began to stall or regress on some of my lifts towards the fifth week and my joints felt a little off. I think it's due to the fact that for the last three mesocycles I've been very push focused in my 3-day full body split. 3 full 6-week mesoscycles of push may be my limit, so I may look to test this again in the future with different week variations in future macro cycle programmings.

I also realized I built up a lot of systemic fatigue from the physical therapy exercises I do everyday to combat my neurological issues. So I'm going to start building my programming with that in mind going forward so I don't end up possibly injuring myself or stalling on my lifts faster.I plan to do 1 more mesocycle, mainly full body focused and less emphasis on push as I transition into my cut. I originally was looking to bulk up until March, but this mesocycle I switched my goals up after doing some thinking. I considered on planning my cut at the start of February since I will also be deloading during these mesocycles as well, taking me a little extra time to get back down from 190lb - 170lb by June.

I'm one week into my cut so I guess the next couple of weeks is when I should see the daily trend shake out (already down to 66 from 66.9 kgs, but I suppose a lot of that is just water and glycogen).

This is my first attempt at a cut after bulking in a not very strict way (not enough protein) for around five months.

I'm 66kgs, 171cms, approx 19-20% bf, and a bit sedentary on non-workout days, although I try to do about 2-4 hrs per week of cycling, depending on the weather. Total exercise time is about 7 - 10 hours per week, with most of that being a 4-day upper/lower split. Current macro split is approx Carbohydrates 35 %, Fat 30 %, Protein 35 %.

The [legion athletics weight loss calculator](https://legionathletics.com/tools/weight-loss-calculator/) puts my recommended weight loss calories at anywhere between 2100, and 1800, depending on the activity level adjustment.

TLDR: Should I eat more on exercise days (around or just over 2000) and less on rest days (around 1800), or just split the difference and eat around 1900 every day?","naturalbodybuilding",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/13h9qku/cutting_eat_extra_on_workout_days/"

My understanding, based on Israetel, is that hypertrophy comes from increase in volume, emphasis on the ""increase"" in that phrase not ""total volume"". As long as you're able to do the next set at the 5-15 rep and near failure, that's a valid, completed working set as any other. Therefore, you can rest 1-min and while you'll lift less total volume, it doesn't matter because you're tracking increases.

I've done the Warlock program and now I'm doing the Creeping Death II program. A few other programs I've done in the past include the RP templates, PPLs found on bodybuilding forums, starting strength and so on.

John Meadow's programs seems to include a lot of work which pump the muscle without really exhausting it, or with all due respect, exercises that seem bro-sciency. For example, on the pull day for creeping death, one of the exercises is literally just hanging from a chin up bar with weights on for 60 seconds.

Then you've got another exercise on the second pull day called [supinated pull downs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLfsoU9yYe4&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLA808445EA052D63A&amp;index=11&amp;ab_channel=mountaindog1). I can't get anywhere near to a RPE of 9 for 10 reps, which John prescribes, because I'm not anchored down and I have to drop the weight significantly, which he also acknowledges. In the description, John writes that the exercise is to ""continue to pump and drive blood into the lats"". He also includes an ab exercise as the last exercise to drive blood away from the back and into the abs.

Then on a push day, he recommends a floor dummbell press supersetted with flyes. I'm confused about this, because a floor dumbbell press seems inferior in every way because of the lack of range of motion.

He also expects you to have 3-4 warm up sets on all exercises, this includes accessories like barbell curls or flyes. And he doesn't want you going to full lockout on pretty much most exercise as it takes tension off the muscle. And the Creeping Death II pdf is quite unwiedly, I'm confused as to why it's not an excel spreadsheet instead.

I'm just confused, and I'm just doing the program for novelty's sake at this point. But what other programs exist out there? I'm no longer a big fan of RP as I once was, since I've seriously began doubting Mike Isratel's credentials after he started publishing his questionable politics and philosophy. But it seems like this whole field is just rife with broscience, it's a wonder how anyone gets jacked at all.","naturalbodybuilding",31,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/192cvge/john_meadows_program_review/"

I am  20F 5'3 110 lifting for about a year. I started a pretty intense training period and was bulking from about June to now (writing this in December) but it all started to fall apart at the end of Nov. Push/Pull/Legs with 5 exercises a session, 3-4 sets. I made awesome gains in that time. I never ran a deload. My sleep wasn't perfect over that time. I trained everything with high intensity, especially over the past 2-3 months, when I would train to failure often. On leg days I would be too tired to do anything for the rest of the day, but I was progressively overloading and getting so much stronger every single session. I am a current college student with a pretty busy life. My sleep started to get bad. I hit a HARD plateau and lost mind muscle connection. I should have deloaded at this time but did not. I ended up getting sick like a week later. My digestion started to get bad too, with bloating and feeling fluffier around my middle despite eating around maintenance.   
My stress was particularly high with final exams last week. I got sick with a fever in the first week of December, on the 3rd, right before my exams (Dec 4-16), and had to do all my work despite being sick, which put my stress levels to a point where my heart rate was like 94-97 sitting at my desk. The viral infection made me pretty tired. My sleep was bad, and being sick caused my calories to falter.   
I have been out of the gym since the 16th, my last session. I was so weak in my session and I got physically exhausted like 2 sets into a workout I usually complete with intensity twice a week. On the 17th, I got to fly home for winter break.   
It has now gotten to the point where I am having extreme fatigue and do not feel like myself mentally or physically at all. From the 17-20th, writing this now, I have been having extreme fatigue for the first time in my life. I am talking to the point where I can barely leave bed, and havent left my house for as much as a walk. I have crazy brain fog. I get dizzy randomly and have the urge to sleep all day- this is coming from a hyperactive person who walks 10k steps a day has a 4.0 in college and lifts intensely 6 days a week, Now i am bound to my bed. I get dizzy easily   
Even thinking of the gym makes me shudder, but I want to lift SO BADLY. I am so sad to be out of the gym, but I am literally physically incapable of lifting, and have no idea why. Its like my muscles are ""afraid"" to lift.  
I got a bunch of bloodwork done to check everything and I am checking everything like Iron, Vit D, etc.   
I am scared and sad that I suddenly am so weak. Is this burnout or some sort of stress response? I did not realize it could be so debilitating.

The scale went from 235 down to 230 in the first 2 weeks, but just bounces between 232-230 for the past 2 (trying to get to 220 by mid Jan).

This April, I started losing weight again, but this time I also started to do Jeff Nippard's PPL program, started to do progressive overload, started to go to failure on every set, and saw good muscle gains.


But after 2 months of doing that, I started to wake up after sleeping just 5 hours everyday, and unable to go back to sleep. I also lost a lot of hair, some of which has started to come back now. 2 months ago, I reduced my deficit to 500 cal and reduced the number of sets in every exercise from 3 to 2, which has improved my sleep a bit, but I'm still facing the same issues. Now I'm sleep deprived, tired and have a mild headache most of the day. Usually I sleep only 4-6 hours, then after a few days I get so sleep deprived that I get 8 hours of sleep for a couple of days, then it's back to 4-6 hours. Also, when I wake up, I always have to pee. Even on days where I get 8 hours of sleep, I still wake up after 5 hours, just that I'm able to go back to sleep on those days.


Regarding my weight loss, I still have 40 more pounds to go.


What should I do now? Not be in a deficit for some time? Stop doing progressive overload? Reduce my volume even more? Reduce my intensity? Or go for a sleep study? I like my muscle gains and don't want to lose them, they are making me look better than ever, but I'm afraid of impairing my cognitive abilities due to sleep deprivation.

I finished mesocycle 1 and enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, and I learned a few valuable lessons moving forward 

-Sandbagging the initial RIR 3 week is easier to do than it appears. 

-Because I accidentally sandbagged, I got a lot of work in the 15-20 rep range& and that led to what Id call newb gains 

-I love Dr. Mike and his content, and it may be because I sandbagged the initial test, but the deload just felt& unnecessary. Ill die on that hill, but Im also willing to run it back after making the adjustments I learned from the initial mesocycle, and my mind could very well change. 

For this mesocycle, I challenged myself to do even more higher rep work, with the exception of my compound lifts (Sumo deadlift, Bench Press, Safety bar squat)& Im still a powerlifter at heart, and I want to maintain heavy technical proficiency in the 3-8 rep range. 

My second mesocycle has an average rep per exercise of 14. I havent ever challenged myself in this rep range, as my lifting background has been for sports and then powerlifting. 

I also increased the mesocycle length from 4 weeks to 5. More work in the mesocycle may result in a need to deload? 

I loved the idea of a 4 week mesocycle, but it felt like I was only getting 2 weeks of actual hard work. 

After the first three RIR 3 total body days, I actually feel sore, which is a sign I have course corrected the intensity needed to grow more. 

For nutrition, Im not tracking anything but total protein. This may or may not have an impact on the actual results& but tbh Im too busy to work that hard to count macros. Im just working hard and aiming for 160g per day of protein.

"2023-06-29",1688038397,"Why I am training in a Heavy Duty/High Intensity style as a natural lifter","i wanted to share my viewpoint on why i train in a HIT/Heavy Duty style training as a natural lifter and why i totally love it.

20Y M lifting for about 2 1/2 years (161 lbs, 5 foot 10 inch, 12% bf). Currently Training 4 times a week 2x Upper 2x Lower Body

When i first started out and was working with a tipical volume approach where you perform multiple sets and stay a few reps shy to failure i made decent gains but i always thought i am leaving some gains behind.

I realised there are three aspects to muscle hypertrophie
-Frequency (how often do you train a muscle in a specific time frame e.g. one week)
-Volume (how many sets do you perform for a muscle in a specific time frame)
-Intensity (how close do you push to muscular failure)

if we want maximum muscle growth we have to adjust these three to one another. To make this more clear a hypothetical formular would be

Muscle Growth = F x V x I 

To make this concept more clear here are two examples.

Assumption: you are able to perform 50 Push Ups till failure 

Example 1:
-You perform 10 pushups every 7 days
in this case we have very low Volume (1 set), low frequency (once a week) and very low intesity
everybody will agree that this is too little effort to stress the body enough to adapt

Example 2:
-You perform 10 sets of AMRAP everyday
In this example we have high volume, high frequency and maximum intensity
After the second or third day you will not be able to move your arms and the stress you put on your muscles is too high to recover from

If we can agree on this we will soon come to the conclusion that the way to go is somewhere in between and that there are multiple ways to solve 100% = F x V x I

That means if one variable gets higher we have to lower another one (When training more frequently we reduce the amount of working sets)

In my opinion you should take every working set to failure because of the following reasons:
- Henneman size principle
- easy to track
- you cant lie to yourself (either you took the set to failure or not - e.g a set of leg extensions feels like 2 RIR but if someone put a gun to your head you could have gotten 5 more but you pussied out because of the pain)
- you are not a bitch

so now we only have 2 variables left. I would look at frequency first and this is really individual just based on your life situation and what is fun for you (here are some guidlines you may follow)

1-3x/week: Full Body
2-4x/week: Upper/Lower or Push/Pull
4-6x/week: PPL/Arnold/Yates Split

The more advanced you are the more you need to split your body. There is no need for a beginner lifter to do a 5 Body split unless thats what brings the most joy to your life.

So now we know that we need to train hard and to choose a split based on the time we want to spend in the gym and how advanced we are.

The only thing left is to play around with the volume until we find the sweetspot

Id always start with 1 working set per excercise and with 1-2 excercises for big muscle groups and 1 for the smaller ones.
Depending on the safety of the chosen excercise stay in the 5-20 rep zone

Unless you are extremly advanced you should be able to add reps and or wheight every single seassion this way. And since mechanical tension is the biggest driver for muscle hyperthropy this is a easy way to track your progress. If you find yourself not adding reps or wheight, cut down the volume. if you add reps and wheight and feel you could recover more add one excercise with one set (or one backup set) and see if you still make progress.

Since switching to this training at the beginning of this year i am spending the least amount of time in the gym ever and make the best gains of my life.

I am not saying this is the only one or best way to find a workout that suits you bit it certainly is for me right now and i think the idea of adjusting frequency, volume and intensity is helpfull.

Ive been running a PPL split and despite that fact that I have seen significant growth and improvement on literally every other part of my body, my upper chest refuses to grow. I make sure to eat clean and get enough calories as well as pay attention to my sleep and recovery. When it comes to upper chest training, Ive tried literally many things because I wanted to make sure I will do it the proper way. I have double checked my form a hundred times, always setting the bench on a 30 degree angle, I prefer dumbells over barbell, I make sure I retract my scapula and keep my shoulders back and down and always control the form especially during the eccentric part, while checking my elbows so that they wont flare a lot keeping them in a roughly 45-60 degree angle during the motion . Nevertheless, my upper chest never gets sore, never gets pumped and sometimes I feel like as if a muscle on my right shoulder blade is getting fatigued before my upper chest, as If it is overtaking the exercise. I tried decline push-ups and the same thing happens again, a muscle on the back near my shoulder blade starts getting sore before my chest.
Yet, I have always taken care of my shoulder blades by incorporating a lot of rear delt work, always warming up my rotator cuff and my infaspinatus before my push day. 
I have no problem when it comes to my mid or lower chest, I am trying to find if this has to do with any imbalances that might have been created due to bad posture or instability.
Has anyone dealt with anything like that and is willing to share some thoughts?

"2023-04-01",1680348762,"Your take/thoughts on Hard Sets (e.g: 0-2 RIR)","Hi all,

Recently been seeing lots of social media posts (by reputable coaches / subject matter experts) discussing hard sets, say a top set at 0-2 RIR (often 0-1 RIR) and then some back offs with similar failure ranges to elicit 'effective reps' or stimulus, but overall still subscribing to that 10-20 hard sets a week recommendation.

Personally, the above theory makes sense to me, as opposed to programs where you just see generic 4x12 of A,B and C exercise.  This to me suggests that there may not be an actual 'hard' set that elicits proper mechanical tension and you're really just doing the exercise/sets for the sake of doing it. 

Additionally, any more of these sets are just accumulating fatigue, while most of the stimulus/benefits have already been extracted, so it becomes diminishing returns. 

Plus the former (with the hard set) would reduce time in the gym and you get out faster :)

I'm 30 in 7 days (=-), been working out in the gym bodybuilding training for nearly 8 years (although probably 1 year worth of breaks due to injuries).

I'm just lost on if I should keep doing deadlifts or RDLs.

I herniated my disc last week, I herniated it last year, and the year before, couple years before that I herniated it for the first time doing heavy seated cable rows, and before that I slipped on ice and fell on my back which didn't injure a disc(I think) but hurt my lower back a lot.

Recent years have been fine for squats, like I haven't ever injured myself doing squats, and I do heavy pin squats, which is strange.

But deadlifts seem to be high risk for me, like I switched completely to RDL's this past year because I was done with heavy deadlifting after the previous disc herniation injury was so serious I couldn't shit or sit, or even stand still, without pain.

But even so, I seemed to have injured my disc again even though I was lifting moderate weight and had good form, and I warmed-up a lot this time. I think it could have just been I was a little sleepy or the weather/barometric pressure caused joint stiffness or muscle spasm.

But I'm worried about my spine because I injured it so many times in the past.

Now the first 2 weeks were going amazing and I dropped 1.3kg/2.85lbs a week then 1.4kg/3lbs the week after only for things to slow down by almost 50% for the following 2 weeks, having lost 0.7kg/1.55lbs and then 0.8kg/1.75lbs for weeks 3 &amp; 4.  
  
I'm slightly surprised and somewhat disappointed comparing weeks 3 &amp; 4 to the first two weeks and now I'm not entirely sure if perhaps the first two weeks just had a lot of water weight or if perhaps I am just forgetting that during a cut weight loss isn't linear and that sometimes it's more staggered and I'm just slightly on edge because the numbers aren't budging as well as they were in the first two weeks.  
  
Any advice, support &amp; insight would be appreciated.

I'm looking at combining Jeff Nippard's Arm hypertrophy with another programme but I'm not sure how best to do it.

Does anyone have any experience with a shorter-style programme I can pair it with, that yields good muscle-building results? My goals are hypertrophy of the upper body really, I want to cultivate mass (Always sunny reference) efficiently but with an arm bias, hopefully, brought around by the arm hypertrophy programme.

The way the arm hypertrophy programme works is you have one dedicated arm day per week, with one supplemental arm section, bolted onto your other workouts, 2 times per week.

So my 5-day workout split would look something like this -

Mon - Workout with Arm supplement A

Teus - Workout

Weds - Dedicated arm day

Thurs - Workout

Fri - Workout with Arm supplement B

&amp;#x200B;

1. Don't marry any particular exercise

When I was initially starting out, I was influenced heavily by the ""power building"" crowd even though my goals were always purely hypertrophy based. This crowd painted a picture that squat , bench and deadlift were the king of all movements  and mandatory to build a good physique. The issue was that I have incredibly long femurs and always got very little out of the squat from a quad hypertrophy perspective. As soon as I took the barbell squat of a pedestal and switched to leg movements more suited for my build like leg presses and leg extensions, my quads blew up. My training now is actually purely machine based because I feel like I can connect with the muscle so much more without having to worry about stability. Some of my favourite machines that I couldn't train without would be the hammer incline press, the precor leg press and the hammer iso row. I guess the summary with this point would be if you feel and get a great connection with squat bench and deadlift, by all means continue preforming them as they are not bad exercises whatsoever. I just wanted to preface the point that you don't HAVE to do them from a hypertrophy standpoint. There a plenty of alternatives that may work better for you and it is important to explore those options. 

2. Intensity &gt; Volume 

Now this one is highly debated , is it better do train with a few reps in reserve and do more sets? or zero RIR with less sets/volume? Well from my experience, I can definitely say I got a lot more out of a lower volume, higher intensity approach. I find that with a lower amount of sets, you can mentally push a lot harder. If I know I only have 2 sets on a leg press versus 4, I have the mentality of making the most out of those two sets. Where as in the past when I had 4-5 sets, it would be easy to sandbag the first couple. I also like hitting zero reps in reserve because it ensures me that the set was effective. Previously training with RIR, it would be tough to gauge whether a set was RPE 8,7,6 etc. When Im in a set now, all I have to focus on is getting the most amount of reps possible. I don't have to use any mental energy mid set to think about how many reps I am away from failure. Summary for this point would be I believe the lower volume approach really highlights  quality over quantity and teaches you how to actually train with intensity because you are forced to get the most amount of reps in each set. As a personal example of my current set up, I have a weekly volume of 12 sets for most muscle groups (slightly higher for back as its made up of more muscles and can generally tolerate for volume) , split up into a 2x a week frequency. (so 6 sets each workout for a given body part). I take each set to 0 reps in reserve, but I rarely allow for form breakdown and try not to actually ""fail"" a rep if possible. 

3. Don't put direct arm training on the back burner

In everyday life, the first thing people will notice on you is your arms. Think about how often your arms are being shown versus other muscle groups. If anything , arms are arguably the most important muscle group if you want to look impressive to the average person yet this is often an afterthought in a lot of peoples training. One of the biggest mistakes I made early on was always doing my arm work after chest or back. What this led to was underdeveloped arms for me in the first few years. Now I see a lot of people have success with a PPL split but for me, I never felt like I could train my triceps hard enough after chest or train my biceps with enough intent after back. As soon as I started to experiment with training arms on their own, I immediately noticed my connection and pump was much better. I was also able to progress my curls and pushdowns at a much faster rate. Now while my arms are still lagging, I believe training them away from chest and back will help me catch them up to some my other body parts within a few years. For some insight of how I currently have everything set up, I am on an Arnold split. With this split, I can train arms with shoulders and with my shoulder training being mostly raises and not presses, I can hit my triceps super hard on these days. My biceps are also given the chance to be worked quite intensely on this day. Another benefit with this set up is an increased frequency for arms as you hit them twice a week directly and twice indirectly. If your arms are particularly lagging like mine are, perhaps this added frequency can help. The research showing better hypertrophy results when volume is equated on 2x a week vs 4x a week frequency is not very promising but Im willing to give it a shot here. 

So yea, here are 3 of my biggest takeaways I could think of after experimenting with a lot of different  things over the past 4 years. 4 years is not a ton of experience by any means and Im still learning many things as I go. Just thought I would share some insight .... Perhaps I can make another post in the future regarding nutrition if y'all enjoyed this one.","naturalbodybuilding",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/10jok0c/3_of_my_biggest_lessons_learned_after_4_years_of/"

My last update only got posted to r/bodybuilding (found here: [205lb Physique](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/zfq4or/current_offseason_physique_natural_510_205lbs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)), but was done at around 205lbs a few months back after coming down from a peak bulk weight of 220lbs (510 for reference).

Im currently at 194-197lbs (Current Physique: [195lb Physique](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpfFa_MODlB/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)) depending on daily intake and activity levels with a goal of getting down to 190lbs or so prior to the birth of my second daughter late March or early April. The months following will very likely be maintenance months due to inherent sleep deprivation, nutritional fluctuations, stress, inability to consistently train, etc.

Current intake is a range depending on how Im feeling for the day. On days Im feeling fresh and reach the end of the day not overly hungry Ill dig a little deeper, on weeks/days where fatigue from life/work/diet is accumulating I reduce the overall deficit. Targets are 200-240P 275-300C 45-60F. Very autoregulated approach to food simply dependent on gym performance and weekly rate of loss. I create a foundational diet from 3-5 meals that say consistent and change 1-2 as needed or desired for satisfaction or to enjoy a meal out with the family.

As we have grown and mod passion has declined you have probably noticed a decline in quality of the sub, especially when we finally opened the floodgates to allowing all posts and just removing low quality/beginner ones. In order to get back to that level of quality we need a bigger mod team straight up. At least 3 more but ideally around 5, Nitz and I do what we can but are very busy so it's time to pass the touch to more dedicated individuals who can help the sub continue to grow and improve.

With that out of the way feel free to use this post for suggestions on how to improve the sub once we have more manpower. Applications please follow directions below, comments to this post will not be considered.

**Preferred qualifications for mods**:

* Active and long time member of the community

I saw an interesting suggestion on here the other day which was to swap biceps and triceps to the opposite day (and do PLP so you can get enough rest for them when they need to do the other day).  

My question is whether this is actually beneficial? Like, yes, if Im doing tris on my pull day then I can do heavier weight on that day (which is great); however, if I do them on my regular day and Im still giving it my all, would that still result in the same hypertrophic effect since Im working as hard as I can (but lifting less because my arms are just tired). I guess another way to ask the question is whether the added mechanical tension by swapping the days is actually going to matter when in both cases Id be trying just as hard.

Ok so two weeks ago I made a post, which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/11suc1z/im_having_almost_no_luck_building_muscle_whats/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), about how I was not gaining muscle no matter what I tried.  I talked about how Im doing the Renaissance Periodization Male Physique template workout program, which uses the concept of reps in reserve (RIR).  I got a lot of feedback suggesting I go up in weight and go to failure each set because I was likely underestimating my RIR and didnt have a good idea to failure.  So I decided to do just that and record myself on the sets to get feedback on my form and whether Im hitting failure properly.  I was definitely leaving reps/weight in the tank on a good chunk of workouts, others I wasnt. 

What I plan to do is follow this workout scheme for a few weeks, go to failure each set, increase reps/weight where I can, and then reassess to see if Im making progress.  I check my progress by measuring arm circumference (same time and position every day), by weighing myself, and by pictures.  Im also considering switching up my meal timing.  I have a mass gainer shaker and eat a breakfast and then a lunch at around 11:30, so 5 hours before my workout.  Then I eat after my workout.  I have LPR (a form of acid reflux) and so thats why I dont eat before my workout, because it can trigger it.  But perhaps I need to eat closer to 2-3 hours before my workout so I have more energy?

Anyway here are my results, i.e. my workouts. Let me know what you think about my form and going to failure.  I know its a lot of videos, so if you look at anything please just look at my rows and pulldowns, because thats where Im the most unsure of if Im judging failure correctly.  Im also unsure about where exactly failure is on the ab machine.

I'm relatively new to my fitness journey. It's been 4 months since I decided to go to the gym and change my lifestyle. So far, it's been a blast.

These past few months I've learned a lot about food, how the human body works, and how my own body works. I found it fun to calculate my TDEE and calculating my recommended protein and calorie intake. Apparently, it does take some trial and error to know what works best for my own body.

I find it fun to measure food and checking how much calories are in it. I know some people might say counting calories and measuring food could lead to eating disorders, but personally I am amazed by how much I learn about food just by reading nutrition facts, or by weighing it and checking in MyFitnessPal.

Right now my target calorie intake is 1500 calories. Previously it was at 1700-2000 but I barely lost any weight. I feel satiated without having a restrictive diet. 1500 seems like a challenge, but for some reason I feel motivated to try my best to stick to it because it's like a realistic personal goal that I can take pride in.

"2024-01-04",1704343554,"Programming While in a Deficit","Should I drop volume, should I reduce training intensity&both?   
  
It is my current opinion that we SHOULDNT do anything until our body indicates a NEED to alter training via way of performance drops, reduced recoverability, increased muscle soreness, onset of musculoskeletal pain, etc.

Most trainees should be able to at least maintain performance for a moderate period of time up to the majority of the deficit depending on starting body composition - meaning for most trainees they should still train as if they intend to progress and grow - until health and performance markers indicate that that is no longer a feasible option.   
  
When changes do occur my preference is not necessarily to drop weekly volume across the board or slash training intensity, but to reallocate volume away from the more systemically fatiguing movements and maintain intensity where possible.   
  
Barbell and heavy machine compounds might be reduced from 2-4 sets down to 1-2 while isolations inherit those additional sets. This reconfiguration of training volume should allow intensity to remain high throughout the deficit; however, the addition of intensity techniques might be an option for some to artificially drive intensity higher through less systemically fatiguing methods than straight sets (myo-reps, rest-pause, tempo training, lengthened partials, agonist supersets, etc.) when nearing the end of a deficit.   
  
At a certain time I might prefer to adopt more stable movements and substitute out things like a barbell row in favor of a chest supported machine row where the exertion to stabilize isnt something I have the capacity for. But again, this comes as a response, not pre-emptively.   
  
These are all potential routes, not a given, not necessary, and only executed as needed.  
  
TLDR: the things that built the muscle in a surplus will help maintain the muscle in a deficit.

Hi I'm 23 and I'm insecure as fuck. I'm extremely insecure about the way I look (face and body). I low key think I have some form of body dysmorphia.

When ever I walk past a mirror or car window to see if im attractive enough. I'll literally stare at my face for long periods of time to try and see if my face is  attractive enough or not. I've spent around £120 on a complex Korean skin care routine just to make myself a little more attractive. I've seen improvements in my skin.

I'm also planning on taking steroids in around 5 years after 5 years of natural lifting. The only thing holding me back from steroids is the fact that it can age your skin; but apparently that only happens if you take growth hormone. I'll sometimes spend long periods of time just looking at blemishes on my face. 

I've been told by quite a few people that I'm attractive/handsome etc but I'm still super paranoid about it. It's just so exhausting that I'm thinking like this it literally stresses me out. I've had so many things in my life go wrong I'll lie in bed for hours at a time just thinking about my past trauma. I'm going to go to therapy (pshycoanalysis) to try and get some insight into my issues.

I get it! I, too, used to ""paralysis by analysis"" the shit out of myself. The sooner you can get over that hump, the sooner your gains will come.

Novice and intermediate lifters should not be making their own program. There are countless programs developed by people much smarter, more experienced, and handsomer out there. Most are free and many others can be found for free with a little searching in the right place. Here's what to do: 

Find a program that fits your availability and goals and run it exactly as written. Take notes throughout; were you able to properly engage and disrupt the targeted muscles? Did you recover on time for your next session? Did your joints or tendons hurt? How was your sleep and diet? 

If it helped you reach your goals without bothering your joints, you found a winner! Deload a week or however long it takes to feel mentally and physically ready and run it again! 

Did it mostly work, but a couple moves bothered your joints? Deload the same, make a couple small exercise swaps, and run it again!

Did it work, but you're too mentally or physically fatigued to run it again right away? That's fine, too! Find another program and come back to this when you're ready. 

Did it not work? Ok. Time to take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself ""why?""; Did you expect to grow, but didn't eat in a calorie surplus? Did you say, on week 1, ""this isn't enough"" and do a ton of extra shit, affecting the rest of the program? Or conversely, did you sandbag your accessories?  Did you over estimate the weight used and strain your tendons? Were you ego lifting? Does your form just blow? Drinking a lot of alcohol? Are you trying to train for soccer or BJJ 6 sessions a week on top of this? Is anxiety ruining your sleep but your toxic masculinity keeping you from talking to a therapist? Were you not consistently able to make every day of the program? 

There's a million reasons why your program failed, and that's fine, too! Learn why it failed this time and make the proper adjustments. There's a never ending list of things you can do to better your workouts, your recovery, and your overall self - but trying to create your own program is not a good use of time, at all. 

Get after it, and good luck. Remember: it's a marathon, not a sprint.

Straps I've only ever really used for RDL's and very heavy dumbbell rows and it has worked. I haven't had any issue feeling my back work without straps and usually with chalk my grip starts failing when my back couldn't squueze even half a rep out anyway. But man..lately getting a good stimulus for my back has gotten harder and grip has become an issue with lighter back work. For example yesterday my first set of reverse grip lat pulldowns felt awesome and I failed at 16 reps with a super intense lat contraction. Set 2, I fail at 11 reps when my lats could probably go to 14. Set 3, grip fails at 9 reps while my lats would definently handle 11 reps. Heavy back work is even worse: with 90kg I repped out a very solid 12 reps on the barbell row a week ago. Last time I tried to go up to 95kg, grip failed at 5 reps.

I'm wondering if it might be the time for me to finally bite the bullet and just buy some nice lifting straps for all direct back training.

"2023-02-18",1676742824,"My issues with measuring hypertrophy by strength increase","Ive been working out for almost 2 years now (a lot of it sub-optimally) and Id say Im close to an intermediate level in the sense that I no longer have linear progress with my lifts. My goals are 100% hypertrophy, I dont care about strength at all, but I use strength increases to measure my hypertrophy progress, which leads to the situation below.

During the last few weeks of my first bulk that I finished 2 weeks ago, I was hitting plateaus that I could not figure out how to break through even though I was gaining weight. And it was causing me to go through the following cycle -&gt;

(My progression scheme on bench is once I hit a weight for 3x12 with good form, I add 5lbs and go for 3x8 and build up to 3x12)

1. Feeling really good on Push Day A, hit 140 3x10 PR. Last set was say 9-10 RPE

2. Five days later Push Day A again, I hit 140 3x10 with similar results, last set RPE 9-10

3. Next week on Push Day A, my first set of 140 feels so heavy, I can get 10 reps but at RPE 9. There's no way I can get 2x10 with good form.  

AND HERE IS MY ISSUE : I get so in my head about if I cant lift as much as I could the last session im getting weaker and smaller and I feel so attached to tracking my lifts and not going backwards, that I FORCE myself to do 2x10, by worsening my form (speeding up the eccentric, starting to push with other muscles). I end up not getting a great stimulus in my chest and I feel like this is hurting my joints when I train like this.   The following chest sessions go the same way until im forced to drop the weight.

So many questions are: How do I solve this bad pattern?

If I am going backwards in terms of how much i can lift, is this a sign that my diet/recovery/training is poor, or is this normal to experience? 

What should I do when I feel that first set seems too heavy?

Kind of a tangential question, but how do you know if you're making progress or your form is just deteriorating week to week?


EDIT :

The above doesn't give a good indication of my programming (not saying its good, but I dont ONLY bench)

I do chest 3 times a week, and have 2 separate days with different exercises. The reason I focused on my Bench is because that lift highlights what my issue has been with tracking progress

Push A :

- Barbell Bench
- Dumbbell Incline
- Machine Press
- Some isolation work for shoulders and triceps

Push B : 

- Flat DB bench
- Barbell Incline
- Cable Flys

Given that they recommend between 10 and 20 sets per muscle per week for hypertrophy on a bulk (start at the lower range and add sets over the course of a mesocycle), could I really get away with doing 15 sets/3 = 5 sets of chest per week (for me for example, as I did mostly 15 sets of chest on my bulk as I wanted to target this muscle)?

On the flip side, the danger of having too much volume is that you build up fatigue too quickly and need to take a deload, which should be done on maintenance calories, so thats a week that Im not losing fat, which is obviously not great.

I have been properly working out in the gym for 1.5 years now (plus some limited home stuff before that).
I finished a 3 month cut on June 1st at 81.5kg, then started a bulk that I'm 6months in now. Current body weight is 87.5kg.
I have set some strength goals for myself that I'd like to reach before cutting again, and I'd ideally also like to build some more muscle mass before that.

I've been bulking up around 1kg per month and I'm planning to keep that until April where I'd be around 92kg. After that I want to cut again and lose 7kg in 3 months.
I'm 181cm tall also.

My question is if there's any significant downsides if I continue the bulk at my current point (87.5kg). Here is a picture to give you a better idea of my body composition:

Would you say I'm good to bulk up 4-5kg more or am I reaching a body fat level where I'll have any significant downsides by doing this? Also, any bf% estimations?

- 140kg bench (current:127.5)
- 180kg squat (current: 160-165)
- 220kg deadlift (current:195 ish)

"2023-10-20",1697834805,"Am I doing too much?","Let me give you some context. I've been lifting weights for about 6 months, following a PPL routine. My routine consists of 3 exercises pero muscle group with 3 sets each (example: 9 sets per chest session), and the same for other muscle groups like back and biceps, totaling 18 sets per week per muscle group. I train 6 days a week, from Monday to Saturday.

I enjoy training almost every day because it greatly benefits my mental health. However, for the past 2 months, I've been feeling stuck. Despite building decent muscle, my gains are becoming less noticeable, though I might have high expectations. In my sessions, I feel more fatigued, sweat a lot, and sense a loss of intensity and ""value"" in each set. I should note that I take each set to failure. 

This has led me to wonder if I'm doing too much, or if I should shorten my sessions. Each session lasts between 1.5 to 2 hours due to extended rest between sets. What advice do you have? Should I change my split and reduce the number of days? The problem is I love going to the gym, and it's become part of my daily routine, except on Sundays. I've tried reducing the set volume, but I never seem to enjoy the feeling. You could say I'm a volume enthusiast.

I do the standard 6 day a week push pull legs split. Most of my body is experiencing fairly decent and regular growth, with the exception of my arms. They have simply reached a plateau that has probably lasted for several months if not half a year. While my chest and back and legs have gotten visibly bigger the past 6 months, Im not entirely sure if my arms have.  
So I of course wanna change this. I usually work my arms after Ive done the main compound movements. So triceps after pressing and biceps after working the back. You obviously already know this haha.  
So how can I change this? I know some people switch it around so they do biceps on push days and triceps on pull days. While others switch to a chest and back - arms and shoulders - legs split.

I cant do a single pull up without band assistance. I was wanted to do pull ups everyday to work my way up to a body weight pull up.

I'd imagine that those who respond well to low volume are also those who are really strong due to high fast twitch fiber make up, so they dont need as much volume to sufficiently fatigue and stimulate themselves, and the inverse would be true for those who would respond to high volume and such.

It inspired me to make a post on it as I think it would be a good discussion topic to dive a little more into. 

It makes a lot of intuitive sense to me. Say I do a set of 12 with 100lb to failure with great technique. Next week I come in and do that same set of 12 with 100lb and great technique. I didnt progressively overload because I didnt do 13 reps and/or 105lb (or any other ways to PO, Im aware theres more). But you cant say that set wasnt stimulative. Its still going to be a difficult, effective set. 

Now obviously a year later that 100lb for 12 likely isnt going to be stimulative anymore. But thats where this thought comes in: to chase stimulus rather than PO, and let PO come naturally through applying effort. 

A year after doing that 100lb for 12 to failure, if I apply effort to a set of the same exercise, I may be doing 120lb for 12. PO has occurred, but it came from me applying effort over time, rather than forcing myself to add weight/reps every session/week/month. 

These are very, very similar things, but they are different and I think this may be a better mindset.  When you have the mindset of PO every x amount of time whether its a session, a week, a month, you may get caught up on the number in the log book and sacrifice other areas such as technique. Its really easy to quicken up your pauses at the lengthened position, speed up the eccentric, etc when the reps are getting difficult and you question whether youll beat what you got last time. Now, you can try really really hard to standardize technique. I know I have. But we are human and it is difficult to do this accurately. I know my brain wants to see my weight/reps go up. Even if its due to slight alterations in form. Longer rest times are another interesting topic with this. I often rest longer than needed between sets of something like curls because I want to ensure I beat the number from last time. 

All sorts of experts and wannabe experts argue about the different variables in this hobby. Volume, intensity, frequency, etc (even though these are dependent dials, when one moves, so does another) ((different topic for a different day)). But what all experts agree on, people like 3DMJ, RP, Stronger by Science, etc, is the most important thing is consistently applying effort over a long period of time. I think this slight mindset shift promotes doing so for even more reasons than what I mentioned. 

Any thoughts on this are great, I think its an interesting discussion to have!","naturalbodybuilding",45,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/17t4ja4/chasing_progressive_overload_vs_chasing_stimulus/"

Weeks 1-6 Back Focused

These weeks I definitely gained some size. Around week 6 my shoulder began to get better, but I sadly was into the leg focused block and couldnt really do much about it. 

Week 7-8 deload 

I took 1 week for a deload and honestly didnt need it. Felt good to take some volume off, but I was already recovering well and probably couldve went straight into the leg focused block

Week 9-14 Leg Focused

This is where it got interesting. A few lifestyle changes happened. I went from:

- a active job to a sedentary 40 hour office work week
- began playing lacrosse again 2x/week
- nutrition was off as well as sleep (Im usually 8-9 hours of sleep, and I was around 6.5-7/night)

The first 3 weeks I felt great and I was progressing on lifts a good amount. Then week 12 happened&.

Week 12 is where it went down the hill. I was following the training program to a tea, and I just was simply not recovering. My lifts were tanking, and I had to substitute some workouts. I should have taken a deload now looking back, but I continued to push.

By week 14, which is the last week of the program, I was physically and mentally drained. I took the workouts and cut them in half some days, doing 1/2 the back and chest workout together instead of doing each body part straight up.


Overall, this program is rough. I gained a lot of knowledge and some size thats most noticeable in my back and hamstrings. I really wouldnt recommend running it unless these three things happen first:

A) youre able to recover properly
B) youre okay with lifting in the 10-15 range even on some compounds
C) youre used to high volume

Due to the nature of my work, I travel quite a lot and work long days (12 - 16 hours) usually about 4 days a week but am on the road for months at a time. At the start of this year, I decided to make training my number 1 priority and only take work that was close to home. I often would turn down jobs because I thought it would interfere with my training / eating. So I was only working 2 - 3 days a week (the minimum needed to cover my bills etc). 

However, i've eventually decided the results just aren't worth the amount of effort i'm putting in. For the last 6 months my days have just been training and eating and almost nothing else. I'll finish a meal and think ""i've got 2 hours till the next one"" better go food shopping and be back for the next meal. I'm sick of living like this. Other areas of my life have withered away because i'm so fixated on bulking and getting bigger / stronger. 

I guess it's just not as important to me anymore. I love lifting and will continue to train, but feel like as a nearly 30 year old, I can't dedicate so much time and resources to something that isn't contributing to my income. And yes I know this sounds shallow. But I'm also essentially limiting the life that my partner could have by not earning more (no holidays, not saving for a house, couldn't support a family like this).

The two rows past the upper abs are more prominent on my person.

So I am at 15% bodyfat dieting down to 12% and maybe 10% if I feel motivated to do so once I hit 12%. I generally do ab machines as heavy as possible for 15 reps and these machines generally target the middle of my abs. I read that since abs are one muscle, it's an all or nothing approach in terms of hypertrophy. So all 8 rows grow or none do.

As the months pass by I notice I can see the middle section (rows 2 and 3) of my abs a lot more prominently than my upper and lower (rows 1 and 4). Lower makes sense, because lower stomach and lower back tends to hold the most body fat and are the last to go, so they would block lower abs. So then why do I not see my upper abs as prominently? There is less body fat  on my torso as it goes up. I have to flex really hard and kind of push my body fat away to see them, so they are there genetically at least.

I read online that abs work as a whole, so it's an all or nothing when exercising abs. Then my upper abs should be as prominent as my second and third row of abs. But they're not. So I am starting to think it is because my ab exercise routine mainly targets the second and third row while my upper abs never get stimulated. I know this for a fact but thought it would not matter as abs are one muscle.

So was my theory incorrect, and I must incorporate upper ab work to hit the top row of abs?","naturalbodybuilding",28,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/140m3x8/upper_abs_not_as_prominently_showing_as_middle/"

However I wonder that does the act of boxing/punching really build delt muscles or do guys who already have nice delts love to box?

I used to be paper thin before getting into lifting, and my first true bulk went really well. I really ate nothing at all before lifting, so just getting shakes down and eating a bit more is all I needed to see great progress. Now I am a few more years into lifting but I have been maingaining. My progress has really started to plateau, and thus I have decided to commit to a proper bulk again.

Now that I am considerably heavier than 2 years ago, I have had to really up the calories a lot more than in my first bulk. As someone with already poor appetite, fats are very clutch to secure more calories. I am not eating fried foods and saturated fats, but just consuming fattier foods (lots of salmon, nuts, nut butters, using more olive oil in cooking).

I have been tracking my nutrition and noticed that fats are between 40-45% of my calorie intake (still hitting my protein goals).

But... After 6 weeks, there's been no change in either muscle mass or body fat on my DEXA scans. Which seems wild, since RP's program has significantly more volume (and felt harder) than my previous programs.

I'll try to include as much info as I can below, but the TL;DR is: **I've been doing Renaissance Periodization's female physique template for the past six weeks and have seen ZERO progress.** What gives??

**More info:**

- Pic of my DEXA scan before and after the program: https://ibb.co/kx75swv
Note: I took the first scan a couple weeks before I started the program, and those weeks were... not good for my diet. I'm pretty sure that's why I didn't see the needle move on my body fat %.

- Pic of a sample week in RP's female physique program: https://ibb.co/jhnHSZ8

**Me:** 33F, 5'1"", 100lbs. Have been focusing on strength training semi-consistently for around 3 years (calisthenics for the first 2 years, and heavy weights/Oly lifting for the past year). Before that, I was pretty seriously into martial arts (krav maga and boxing primarily, a little MMA) for 10+ years. Compared to other people my age/experience, feel like I'm weaker and it takes me longer to gain muscle.

**Goals:** Lose fat and gain (visible) muscle.

**Before:**

- Jumped from program to program (e.g., greyskull LP, a Oly lifting strength/power program, a homebrew powerlifting program, the recommended routine, etc.), generally 2-3x a week for 1-3 months till I got bored

- Did not track macros, probably got around 40-60g/day protein

- Inconsistent deficit that ranged anywhere from 0-500cal/day

- Cardio anywhere from 1-4x/week, even mix of HIIT or SIT and MISS

- Low, but heavy, reps (power/strength-focused), sometimes felt ""too easy"" because of lower reps

- Results varied, but when I consistently maintained my deficit, I generally saw slow fat loss/muscle gain at the same time.

**During:**

- Consistently followed RP's female physique program for 6 weeks (4x/week, 7 exercises per session with varying number of sets, about 1-1.5 hr to complete)

- At least 85g protein/day

- Consistent deficit of 300 cal/day

- Low-intensity cardio (usually walking) ~3x/wk (dialed down the intensity and frequency of my cardio because RP says it can interfere with muscle gain)

- More reps and significantly more sets, but lower weight (hypertrophy-focused)

I know it's only been six weeks and I'm on a deficit, so I can't expect massive results. BUT! Before this I've have no problem gaining muscle &amp; losing weight while on a deficit (there was even one month pretty recently where I gained a whole pound of muscle/lost half a pound of fat while following one of Chris Heria's calisthenics programs, which in retrospect is probably not even a good program, lmao).

I have been casually intrigued by the whole Cross Fit ""movement"" for a while, and yesterday was a rest day for me and I pulled up a documentary on Cross Fit.  Of course lots of things stood out from their ""Pull-ups"" that they do to the amazing array of exercises, to the hard work that they all put into their training.  Almost cult like.  (That's not meant to be derogatory and I can't be the only person who thinks that.)

One of the main things that struck me was how similar all their physiques were.  All the men and all the women had similar physiques (Within the framework of the two sexes.)  Frequently in the bodybuilding world, if you had a thicker waist other folks in the community would tell you, ""Oh, well that's just genetics.""

So is the way they are built a function of their genetics or the types of exercises they do?  They do a lot of exercises that fire off the core and I noticed that almost all of them, while being very lean are all somewhat thick waisted.  They all look good, just a different kind of build than a natural bodybuilding aesthetic.

My current approach is: 4 sets of squats (1 back off), 3 sets of RDLs, 2 sets of back extensions, leg extensions and lying leg curls. 2 sets of adduction and abduction machines. You may argue low volume but although it is seen as highly fatiguing I go to failure on squats. Its about training with intent and not just loading volume. I find most people do so much volume on legs to account for the fact they are too scared to go to failure. You may argue my volume is too low but hamstrings are extremely easy to grow and anymore then 5/6 sets is overkill and as for quads if you go to failure on all sets with extensions and squats you are working the quads in shortened and lengthened position they will be fully stimulated. For adductors and glutes you could get away with no direct volume and they are indirectly worked a lot anyway. This is just my take on training legs and I do believe it is because people do not try hard enough tbh.

1. Get at least 0.8 - 1.0 gms of protein for a pound of body weight.
2. If you want muscles to grow train them twice a week once a week is ok but doing it twice gives the best result. 
3. Training till failure is the best to see the most gains.
4. If you wanna Gain Eat more than your maintenance and if you wanna lose eat less.
5. Other Supplements do help but aren't necessary (Not JUICE or Gear).
6. Both during cutting and bulking Dont go over gaining or losing 1% of the body weight to help retain and maintain muscles

I have been following this science for the last 3 months and I have been in a bulk and then a cut since last 2 months and lost 6 Lbs taking it slow to preserve muscles but I am tired of the slow progress so this is to you natty out there how long does it take to build a good physique with 15-inch arms and good looking abs.

- August 13th: 153.88 lbs
- August 18th: 149.90 lbs
- August 23rd: 158.50 lbs

So my moving average weight went from 149.90 to 156.08 in 15 days.

Using the [Mifflin-St Jeor](https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/) formula, my sedentary BMR is around 1850 cals. Im eating 2650 cals and taking 5g creatine a day.

I modified the Reddit PPL to Push, Pull, Bike, Push, Pull, Bike, Rest, but I do squats and RDLs on push days and leg curls and calf raises on pull days, mainly because I wanna ride my bike on the leg days and on my rest day. 

My apple watch says I spend about 430 cals each workout and ride, I spend 1 hour a day working out or riding my bike, thats why Im going for at least 2600 cals.

Now I dont mind getting a bit of fat on my arms as Im skinny fat and all the fat is on my belly and sides, but is this rate of gain too much? I dont know how much of this is water and when the water retention will stop. I see people saying to aim for 1lbs/week so thats why Im asking.

In one video he remarks that not everyone was continually on steroids, and even then their selection was limited. They also weren't very consistent or scientific about calories either.

Ric says that he just didn't eat anything white (white bread, rice, sugar, potatoes, etc.), and the guys typically ate eggs, hamburger patties and cottage cheese as their main foods, with cheat days on Sunday (spaghetti, ice cream, cake ... anything went). The supplement market at the time was in its infancy, too, so forget creatine and pre-workout mixes. They went for cheese omelets at the nearby diner for protein.

Listening to his stories of the 70s, I really related because I love lifting weights, but the technicalities of bodybuilding today (even natural) are really overwhelming if you want to get into it. I got into weightlifting in 2018 as a fat (maybe even obese) guy with the intention of improving my health, but I just could never get into all the technical aspects of modern training, especially because I am not going competitive. But I still wanted to build muscle and slim down.

I just followed the ""old-school methods"" from the 40s-70s as I pieced it together from various sources: progressive overload (training to failure), low carbs, proper rest periods, and moderate cardio (I walk briskly outside everyday for an hour minimum). Like Ric suggested, I eat meat, cottage cheese, and eggs. I only took creatine for a year or so, but gave up after I moved to Europe where I had to specially order it where I live. I didn't see a difference. I also just drink coffee before the gym. Never took a pre-workout mix.

Anyway, this is what I look like after about five years of training using old-school methods and never having counted a calorie. 37 male, 5""11, 235 lbs.

Another question I ask is do you include extremely low tax and extremely easy isolation exercises such as wrist curls and Dumbell shrugs as proper volume that can cause overtraining?","naturalbodybuilding",21,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/10ojtdw/how_much_is_too_much_volume_for_you_and_what_is/"

Hey guys, for the more experienced people here, just wondering what the general consensus is on the two for chest growth specifically? I've heard time and time again that chest presses are best for hypertrophy but for two years all I did was BB bench and DB bench, with minimal development. In the last year, I've switched to Incline chest machine ( LF ) and cable flyes ( sometimes pec Dec ) and My chests grown a little. Alot more compared to the benching days. I understand the chest needs the upper arm to cross the body so I have to assume flyes are the secret, especially single arm.

Hence, I have decided to do a dedicated bodybuilding period for a few months. Add some mass, gain some weight, build more muscle, then I can return back to strength training.  

To change things up, I have completely stopped barbell benching and have gone strictly to dumbells for all of my free weight chest work. Honestly, it has been amazing switching to dumbells. The mind muscle connection is 500% better, progressive overload has been more consistent, and I can reliably hit muscular failure (+ less time waiting for a bench and warming up too lol). I don't think I can ever go back to barbell now. 

However, I still love strength training, and want to pursue powerlifting in my future. I am having a hard time parting ways with barbell bench for these reasons, but dumbells are just better in every other way for me right now.

For context, several years ago I lost about 35 kg, and have been hovering around 90 kg for the last few years. Over the holidays I ended up as high as 98 kg, so I started a diet and lost 8 kg in two or three months. It was pretty effortless, other than all the tracking and being slightly hungry at night. I'm trying to get down to around 80 kg, ultimately (I am 5'11"").

But the for the last several months, I don't seem to have made any progress at all.

My diet is pretty good, in that I mostly eat whole foods and try to get as much protein as a I can, but I occasionally get so tired and stressed that I will go way over my calorie goals for the day.

I can't imagine cutting back any more, but I also haven't lost any significant weight for months.

I feel especially bad in the afternoon to evening, especially days after gym sessions or long cardio sessions (or both, lol). Other factors I can think of might be alcohol withdrawal (that's how I got fat in the first place...), insufficient sleep (the sun comes up so early in the summer it wakes me up an hour or two too soon), and summer fatigue (it's hot as balls here right now).

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal to some extent, or should I go get a blood panel done?

It feels like am stuck between a rock (need to cut calories) and a hard place (need to eat enough to manage fatigue and stress).

The weird thing is that my hunger levels are fairly manageable, but my energy levels are more inconsistent than they have ever been.

I am at the point of thinking of buying a CGM to see if the fatigue isn't due to low blood sugar.

This may be an unusual post but here we go: I am on the verge of becoming a father. It goes without saying this will bring many changes in my life. 

Lifting is one of my preferred activity I would say I dedicate a lot of my free time to it (avg ~2hours every two days for simplicity).

It is fair to say that my gains will no longer be in the top priority, but I still think it's good to take care of myself to be able to take care of my family. Lifting has changed my life significally for the better and brings me a lot of joy and mental benefits, stopping would probably hurt me mentally more than many other things.

I keep hearing this all the time from older people/colleagues with kids: ""ah you don't have kids that's why you have time to be fit and healthy...."" My thought was always that this was a cope and these people were not better off before having kids (same cope for people who only lifted to get a girlfriend then stopped after), but that may just be me being too optimistic... Now I am entering that territory and I fear becoming exactly this type of person.  

For those that went through it, the lack of sleep must be the major issue, then finding the time? I assume the volume gets lowered by quite a bit too. I'm lucky enough to have a home gym so it should simplify things a bit.

Have any of you been through this (I would assume so) how did you manage your time/expectations etc?

After finishing this season competing around Europe with WNBF (4 competitions/countries), I have come away more confused about things than I was before.. been stewing on this post for a while

Background

Training for since 2018 with everything controlled (i.e., diet and progressive overload) and training with progressive overload since my late teens.. in 30s now.

I am perplexed after seeing the standard.. I would consider myself to have good genetics but I was blown away to be getting outsized by some guys in their early / mid 20s.. I completely get that guys from the younger generations have access to more information online etc (have spoken with my coach about it) but i still cant reconcile it all..

In my opinion to become as optimal as possible, you have to make mistakes and when I try and think about it, these guys in their 20s would have to make zero mistakes to be making these gains which I cannot fathom.

I understand the odd genetic freak but having competed at some of the biggest contests in Europe, it was too common place in my view.

I might get accused of being bitter / whatever.. but when on stage I was first to congratulate fellow competitors and genuinely I was very happy to see so many people interested in natural bodybuilding.. this is a genuine question from someone that has invested years in training / the process

Question(s)

1. Have any other competitors had similar thoughts, and any useful information to share?
2. Anyone else confused about genetic ceilings after competitive seasons?
3. Do enhanced people commonly compete in natural feds?
3. Did anyone else notice an awful amount of enhanced trainers working with natural athletes, and what are your thoughts on this?
4. Side Question - Did anyone find bodybuilding a bit clicky / hard to know what judges were looking for? 


Included some photos just to back up that I compete and think my genetics are ok (I know my legs need more size =).. photos taken evening / post comp.

But is this really important and beneficial as opposed to faster (but still controlled) eccentrics and not pausing in the stretched position? Any difference in hypertrophy? NH claimed that the elastic element when you don't pause also generates hypertrophy and that you might loose some gains if you pause. Israetel's claim is that their is a great potential for hypertrophy when the muscle is stretched and that it makes sense to pause the weight there briefly before going up again. In addition, the could be reduced injury risk.

Are their exercises or muscle groups that benefit more with one method (e.g pause vs. no pause) than the other?

In his recent Tierlist, Natural Hypertrophy listed these two only in B-tier (useful). Mike Israetel points these two out all the time and I would've thought they ranked higher in importance.

I got kinda nerdy, I watched 1000 hours of hypertrophy videos, made 3 workout routines in 3 weeks and tried everything. And finally, I think that upper lower split with rest with rest for that one muscle group if it's still sore and training everything else is the best way for me. I superset antagonistic muscles on all upper body days and drop set on last set of all exercises. I don't have muscles to be pumped at all, I can't see any muscles even when pumped, but the feeling of pump is insane on upper body days and after every set of squats. I feel like there's water balloons in my muscles (i just feel like that, there's nothing to look at in the mirror). my diet is still not so good. my bicep tendons would pain during lat pull downs, I bought lifting straps I finally started feeling my back on back exercises, back pump is more insane that chest pumps. I don't care even if I don't make much progress. Lifting is fun.

But I end up going to failure on all sets, I know I shouldn't, especially on leg movements. and end up looking like an orangutan having orgasms on the last 3 reps. stopping before failure is like masturbating for 10min and stopping right before you ejaculate and waiting for 3 minutes to edge again for 2 more times and not cum at all at the end of it.

IMO the two unilateral exercises I always keep in my rotation are Bulgarian split squats and some kind of cable row.

I've also thrown in some unilateral overhead cable extensions at times, but haven't felt like they're any better than overhead rope extensions or DB skull crushers.

Today Ive just finished an [aggressive mini-cut](https://imgur.com/gallery/I4vmnx4) (7 weeks, -1000cal deficit per day) and went from 152lbs down to 135lbs.


Next bulk is starting next week. I plan to gain only 2 pounds per month instead of 3 (+250cal surplus per day) and I plan to bulk for only 5 months instead of 6 before another, much shorter, minicut.

Im choosing to bulk less aggressively this time around to try to gain a bit less fat (and end up doing a shorter 2-3 week aggressive mini-cut, instead of 7 weeks, at the end of this bulk).

\- However movements that require my chest have lost significant strength.

\- I walk into the gym feeling really good and not sore for chest, and this happens.

\- Went from Larsen Bench Pressing 180 for 7 reps to getting PINNED by 135 after 3 reps. Which never happened before in my life. I had to wait 10 seconds in order to force the bar up. No matter how tired or sore I was I would never get pinned on 135

\- The only changes I added recently was swimming breast stroke, but I have no idea how this could impact my chest strength this much.

\- I had a bit of left elbow tendinitis but that goes away quickly. Maybe this?? But then my pullup strength would not have been impacted. It mostly feels like the chest just can't produce force....

This is a recent study done by a repeatable team (James Krieger, Eric Helms etc.). It compares strength and hypertrophy on trained individuals (benching at least bodyweight etc) at calorie maintenance, 5% and 15% to compare the effect each surplus has on results. 

This is only a very short study unfortunately so it's not going to be enough to draw any concrete conclusions here, but what's interesting is that **there doesn't seem to be any real benefit to being in a surplus over maintenance** here for hypertrophy. 

I'm curious to hear what people's experiences have been being on maintenance, a very small surplus or the typical 300-500 surplus that is promoted everywhere. I've been making my surplus smaller for a while and I haven't noticed any downsides in progression yet (I'm currently on 10% surplus). 

Perhaps we really don't need to be in much of a surplus at all as we once thought, thoughts?

One is the traditional  big compound camp.. squat , bench, deadlift , pull-up, row. All movements that you can overload with heavy weight progressively and target multiple muscle groups. This is great for strength, but often you see small or skinny guys deadlift 700 pounds and dont even look like they lift. Others do well with it . 

The other camp (which is the one Ive been in lately) is that which subscribes to choosing the exercise that directly stimulates you target muscle as a limiting factor while still utilizing compounds. For example , I can lift more weight with a low bar back squat than I can a smith machine front squat. But if Im targeting quads the smith machine front squat is a better choice. It allows me to target the quads better, while reducing strain on the lower back, and doesnt tax the nervous system as much. I feel that training this way reduces my chance of injury as well. Im always asking what I can do to make this movement more difficult and effective.

I'm a big fan of stuff like the 5/3/1 system because it's stupidly simple and you know exactly what you're going to do when you go into the gym. You just plug your lifts into a spreadsheet and you know what you're doing for the day, with assistance work as you feel is necessary.


I've seen countless debate about how this type of training (waving percentages on the big lifts + 50 reps of push/pull/leg assistance work each training day) is more for strength than size and how if you're concerned with size it won't give you the results you desire.


This has confused me a lot and I was wondering if someone could explain to me like I'm 5 years old why this is the case. It seems like a different style of training to me but I can't see why doing this for the next 5 years should give worse results than doing your typical upper/lower style bodybuilding split? All the ingredients are there: progressive overload, big bang for your buck compound movements with isolations at the end, etc..

"2023-06-13",1686672203,"Beyond Heavy Duty: Exploring the Nuances of Muscle Building","I write this because of the recent re-emergence and popularization of Mentzer's Heavy Duty Philosophy. It is best to remember that each individual requires different stimuli, nutrition, and recovery methods to produce the results they desire. Article below:

While Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty training philosophy has been influential in the bodybuilding world, it's not without its flaws. Advocating for high-intensity, low-frequency training, Mentzer's approach can indeed lead to significant muscle growth. However, its one-size-fits-all mentality and lack of emphasis on the psychological aspects of bodybuilding are areas where it falls short. To illustrate this, we can draw parallels with the training philosophies of bodybuilding greats like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dorian Yates, and Jay Cutler.

**Arnold Schwarzenegger: Intensity, Mind-Muscle Connection, and Variety**

Schwarzenegger's approach underscores the importance of mind-muscle connection, intensity, and variety. His belief in pushing the body to its limits, coupled with the idea of visualizing success, created a holistic approach to bodybuilding. This stands in contrast to Mentzer's philosophy, which primarily focuses on the physiological aspects of training.

Unlike the Heavy Duty protocol, Arnold favored high-volume training, often performing up to 26 sets on large muscle groups in a single session. He believed in training each muscle group three times per week, a significant increase in frequency compared to the Heavy Duty regimen. However, Schwarzenegger was also a full-time bodybuilder, and his recovery capabilities may not reflect those of the average trainee.

Arnold also emphasized the importance of exercise selection and load. He advocated for multi-joint exercises that stimulate multiple muscle groups, promoting overall strength and size gain. This is a common ground with Mentzer, who also encouraged heavy, compound movements. However, Arnold's preference for low repetitions with heavy weights provides a distinct contrast to Mentzer's approach, which often didn't specify a rep range aside from one single set to failure.

Arnold's philosophy also highlights the need for variety. He constantly altered his exercises to prevent muscle complacency, a stark contrast to the more rigid, structured routine advocated by Mentzer.

**Dorian Yates: Brief, Intense, and Consistent**

Dorian Yates, another legendary bodybuilder, offered a unique take on high-intensity training. While he agreed with Mentzer on the importance of training to failure, he believed in doing so more frequently. His workouts were short but extraordinarily intense, maximizing muscle stimulation without the risk of overtraining, a concern with high-volume routines like Schwarzenegger's. This approach served as a middle ground between Mentzer's low-frequency, high-intensity philosophy and Schwarzenegger's high-volume, high-intensity approach.

**Jay Cutler: Balance and Recovery**

Jay Cutler's philosophy brings balance to this discussion. Known for his high-volume, high-intensity workouts, he also emphasized the role of proper nutrition and recovery, components that are often overlooked in the discussion of training philosophies. He highlights that training is just one part of the equation, and muscle growth occurs when the body is resting and refuelling.

**Final Thoughts**

The Heavy Duty training philosophy, while effective for some, is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The training philosophies of Schwarzenegger, Yates, and Cutler demonstrate that there are many paths to bodybuilding success. These philosophies highlight the importance of intensity, mind-muscle connection, variety, frequency, and recovery, providing a more holistic approach to muscle growth.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the Heavy Duty philosophy and comparing it to the approaches of these bodybuilding greats, one can develop a more personalized, effective training regimen. It's essential to remember that everybody responds differently to various training stimuli, and the most successful approach is often a personalized one that considers factors like genetics, diet, lifestyle, and individual recovery capabilities.

Regardless of the approach, the underlying principle is consistent: to achieve significant muscle growth, one must provide a strong stimulus to the muscles, followed by adequate nutrition and rest for recovery and growth. This principle holds true whether one is following Mentzer's Heavy Duty philosophy, Schwarzenegger's high-intensity, high-volume approach, Yates's high-intensity, low-volume strategy, or Cutler's balanced and recovery-focused plan.

The key is to take these principles and adapt them to your unique circumstances and body's responses. Whether that means following a strict routine like Mentzer's or incorporating the variety and intensity of Schwarzenegger's, Yates's, or Cutler's approaches, it's all about finding what works best for you and your bodybuilding goals.

In conclusion, while Mentzer's Heavy Duty philosophy offers a unique and effective approach to training, it's worth exploring and integrating elements from the training philosophies of bodybuilding legends like Schwarzenegger, Yates, and Cutler. By doing so, you can create a more personalized, holistic, and ultimately effective approach to your bodybuilding journey.

"2023-10-12",1697142672,"For efficiencies sake, I like the idea of low volume training that seems to be spreading online but I can't reconcile that style of training with all other logic about gaining muscle. Details in description.","As much as I love training, many days it would be great if I could do a quick 30-45 minute workout and not have that voice in the back of my head saying ""you didn't complete the workout"". Some days being able to do a quick workout and bounce would be great for other plans I have that same day.

My only problem is a can't seem to find anyone explaining why low volume would work with any actual logic or evidence.
Also going to ignore the whole ""low volume works because you're more likely to train to failure."" I feel like low volume proponents love to act like people doing higher volume don't train with high intensity or to failure. Just not true. Even at my highest volume I train to absolute failure on each and every working set.

My main issue with low volume training is the observation that anyone who works a muscle with extremely high volume and or frequency seems to have absurdly, even disproportionately large growth of that particular muscle. You see this all the time in any sport. Marathoners with absolutely jacked calves. Rowers with amazing backs. Arm wrestlers with great forearms.

Personally I've experienced this when I went from doing about 20 calf raise sets per week (10 on each of my 2 leg days), to around 70 per week (15 each leg day and 10 each on every other training day). My calves are finally looking great. More growth in a year of doing that (with same diet, rest, and intensity) than the previous 5 years combined.

So what's the actual logic behind low volume? Is it simply ""you're more well rested""? Because I don't buy that. You know who else is well rested?
Someone who doesn't train. There just isn't enough stimulus in my mind. Would love to hear reasons I'm wrong because there's definitely a couple times a month I'd love to just get in the gym for 10 quick sets total and leave.

Part of my wondering about this topic is that tbh Id be a bit bitter if it were actually true that 80% of the time Ive spent in the gym was not necessary (even though I enjoy training) but in my heart of hearts I dont think thats true.

Im also curious if maybe this is just a thing people on huge amounts of gear repeat (Mentzer) because they dont realize theyll grow with even minimal stimulus.

There's quite a lot of variables to keep in mind though. I'd love to have a tool that helps to visualize them, and build a program that provides enough volume, hits the muscles I want at the moment, and allows to try out various variations and also balance the time I'd have to spend in gym.

So, I tried to imagine what it would look like. Came up with the following:

Design: [https://dropshare-astashov.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MacBook-Air-1-1-.png](https://dropshare-astashov.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MacBook-Air-1-1-.png)Explanation: [https://dropshare-astashov.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/weightlifting\_program\_builder.png](https://dropshare-astashov.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/weightlifting_program_builder.png)

It'd be like a web page, one-pager, where you could quickly create a workout program, by adding weeks, workouts and exercises. You specify the weights in 1RM percentage, and it shows how much volume it'd have to each muscle, and for each exercise. You could see how much each exercise contributes to the volume, what's the split of sets per 1RM%, could substitute the exercise to similar exercise targeting same/similar muscles (like bench press to DB press or to narrow grip bench press).

Each workout would have approx time to finish (based on the rest timers and number of sets/reps), you could reduce it by making some exercises supersets.

So, this way you could quickly create programs and make sure you hit the muscles you want to work on with enough volume, and balance with how much time you're okay to spend in gym.

What do y'all think? Or it's too detailed/complicated/unnecessary, and I'm really overcomplicating all of that? :)

I go to the gym 4 times per week and do 15.000 steps daily for cardio.

I finished my 11 week long cut (from 239 lbs / 108.3kg) and am now in week 5 of my reverse diet plan. Went from 2200 kcal per day to now roughly 3000-3500 kcal. 
Body weight remains stable (no longer losing weight), strenght in the gym is returning as well as energy throughout the day. However my libido has actually decreased during my reverse diet. I also did some bloodwork before and after the cut. Free test went from 750 to 580 nmol/dl. All other blood markers stayed the same which were so good my doctor praised me for it. 

So considering all that it is a mystery to me why I'm never in the mood. Not that I'm really bothered by it, but my wife has her needs as well and I'm lacking on that part.

Obviously, extremely suboptimal training will never get you to your peak. 

But does 'good enough' training, long and consistent, get you to the same place, if a bit slower? OR do you believe that fussing over details makes a difference to where you ultimately max out? 

For example, will someone who does both chinups and curls for biceps end up with bigger biceps than someone who only does chinups... or will they just get to the same place faster? 

Another example might be volume: will the person who does 'optimal' volume end up bigger than the person who does 'enough' volume, or will they just get to the same place faster? 

Is there any research out there that sheds light on this? Also happy to hear anecdotal accounts from coaches, etc.; however, I can be suspicious of the perspective of industry people. They often have an incentive to believe that their specific approach, their USP, matters... regardless of how we can all see that people have taken many different roads to the top of the mountain...

I feel like Natural BB would be far more appropriate since most folks here have to have a great handle on their mindset game for the sport/hobby.

Not sure where to begin or where to end but I'll give as much detail as possible in the shortest length.

&amp;nbsp;

**I keep beating myself up for not doing everything perfectly like a robot, ALL the time all year round.**

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like part of this gets exacerbated because I HAVE to use IG for my work as a coach, plus also I train at a meathead-only gym, where everyone is Tupperware bro. (I swear to god no matter what time I go in there I see the SAME people in there all day!)

The beating myself up occurs because I have extremely high expectations of myself in EVERY aspect of my life.

From finances, to of course training, to creating content non-stop, coaching clients, learning more about life, business, gaming etc LITERALLY everything. And frankly, I do well in every single other aspect of my life too. So it re-inforces my self-image that I can do AMAZING at most things in my life I set my mind to. (Cept it seems, bodybuilding? Which ironically has been one of my true loves since I discovered it at the age of 18 yo as a skinny ectomorph kid.)

&amp;nbsp;

One of the things I have realized is that I seem to have forgotten the original true passions for why I lifted. It was to make amazing progress in the gym each session I went in and of course also to see those changes physically in your body as well every 20-30 days or so. I feel like because I shred down to a certain amazing look in the past before, I can't even seem to enjoy my bulking progress, because in my head my vision is to look like the sick aesthetic shredded look (which obviously I currently don't have because I am bulking lol).

I even tried to google or search for some good videos from others on why they started lifting but really couldn't find any good long-form podcast-type videos on why the folks I love started lifting, what was their original true passion and joy. I would love to see some smart mofos like Mike Israetel, Eric HElms, Greg Knuckols, Scott Stevenson, Chad Wesley Smith etc bring it up, like what was some good deeper original reasoning to do what they wanted to do. I feel like it would help me re-center my passion to being internal validation rather than external.

&amp;nbsp;

**One of the MAJOR things that I beat myself up with.** 

The idea in my head that the 'perfect version of me', who never cheats on his diet, never misses a single cardio session, never has a single drink with his friends etc etc that guy would somehow have been 20-30 lbs heavier than what I am right now. There is a really REALLY stupid comparison happening in my head now. I consider myself to be quite smart, and incredibly hardworking. So I have an idealized version of myself, this incredibly smart, incredibly hard working version, who NEVER took a single day off and did everything perfectly. This guy in my head looks like Mr Olympia Aesthetics and ridiculous size to me. So no matter how hard I work now, I will NEVER be able to catch up for the 'lost time and perfection' compared to my idealized image. I KNOW how ridiculously silly this sounds, but it's true this is the weird comparison I have going on in my head.

&amp;nbsp;

**Being unable to enjoy my BIGGEST size and MAXIMUM Gainz Bulk yet till date!**

This last bulk I put on 25-30 lbs, I actually did EXTREMELY well too in terms of body composition imo, but again, because I only was able to do 80-85% of perfect, I think in my head, ""see had you been a 100% robot you wouldn't have put on ANY body fat whatsoever. You would have been completely lean.""

&amp;nbsp;

I think one of the biggest questions I need to have answered in my head is, say my max genetic limit is to put on 15lbs of muscle and 3 lbs of fat this bulk. That's the 100% robot bro.

If I do 80-85% of that. Meaning I eat 80% of my meals clean, and put in some junk food or outside meals for the rest, miss less than 10% of my cardio days required, and never drank those 10 days across the entire past 6 months (now that I am thinking about it, I can't even think of other things I do 'bad'), I have now put on like 9 lbs of muscle and 9lbs of fat, and this is the reason why I suck at Bodybuilding (because I obviously didn't hit the perfect number I could have!). (I also suffer to some extent from Perfectionism clearly lol)

Is there a guesstimate on if you do say 80-85% instead of what's possible, what would a realistic number of muscle to fat look like, compared to the perfect scenario of 15-3? Getting a good idea of a number on this I feel would be able to calm my mind a bit on this end too.

I keep comparing my results to all of the IFBB Pro bros in my gym who seem to keep putting on 20lbs in 2 weeks (not hating on em about PEDs or nothing btw, just envious of what seems like their iron will for food consistency) and keep going, see ""That's the reason why you will never compare, because these guys live the tupperware life, without any taste buds, without any lives, and you can't sacrifice the pleasures in your life to do what they do.

First time I started seriously wondering if the approach had actual merit and wasn't just bro-sciency pre-fatique nonsense. 

I'm now trying this by doing a machine press before a incline dumbbell pressing because for years my shoulder dominance has hindered my chest from doing the work. Obviously can't tell if the gains will be better yet but in the short term I can say that at least during the set I don't feel tension in my delts anymore while my chest feels like it can't take an ounce more tension when I go for that last grinder rep. Previously when I didn't get good results for my chest while my shoulders just kept advancing despite getting way stronger I thought well it just must be a tecnique issue something along the lines of I'm not pulling my scapula back correctly etc. But I ""fixed"" how I pressed multiple times and progressed back to big weights with cleaner and cleaner technique each time. 

I'm now considering going for the same approach with machine hack squats and barbell squats. Yeah heavy barbell backsquats built my quads which are my biggest strong point but it's getting to the point where the load is still a breeze for my quads while my spinal erectors are screaming for mercy. This is despite the style of squat being heel elevated high bar squats atg fully upright and pushing my knees forward to maximize quad drive. Essentially I'm not worried about my quads not growing like I am with my chest. Whatever I'll do they're a genetic strong point and will respond but I'm wondering if I could get the same awesome stimulus out of the backsquats that I love doing but save my lower back's capacity for other movements by limiting the axial loading.

Those are kind of the two scenarios where I can see the approach working for me personally.

Therefore I am interested in finding some role models online who are not just totally obsessed with hypertrophy at all costs, people who practice bodybuilding as a means to being healthy and to enhancing their life. I want to be able to run/hike with a big backpack and not feel in pain for the next few days when I just want to walk to the shop, I want to be able to play football and my ankle not pop out every time, I want to be flexible and to be able to do all the things that I love into old age - so I guess I'm also looking for people who promote longevity as well.

I really didnt track or have any strategy for what I ate after prejudgingm&amp;ms, some chips, peanut butter, rice cakes, a sandwich.

I know this isnt super precise information regarding what I ate, but do you all think it was the food or the quad pump that caused legs to be flatter/look like they were holding water? I suppose I could have just been fatigued and not flexing as hard too, given that this was my first show.

Ive been working out for years without successfully building muscles, however I do feel better overall and less pain in body when working out so staying consistent because of that. Ive tried it all, macro counting, weight lifting and cardio. Atm Im sticking to weight lifting, because my body type is skinny fat. I dont want to loose any more body fat because I really want to bulk right now. However I dont get stronger, I try to up my weights little by little but not able to put more on atm without having joint pain. Ive done all testing at the doctors on why Im not able to become stronger and why Im struggling with joint pain especially in the knees and ankles, and nothing has been diagnosed or no sign that anything is wrong. Eating gluten free lately has been helping with the pain tho, not sure about this connection but Ive been able to add about 5-10 more kilos on the weights but thats about it when completely gluten free.
Ive been talking to my family and my dad talked about when he was younger he was struggling to gain muscles as well and having the skinny fat body type so he gave up on the gym all togheter. I was talking to my moms side of the family and they said they never went to the gym because they all had weaker backs and weakness in body so they was scared to damage themselves. So genetically am I doomed? Supplements Im using is protein shake,pwo, creatine. Im at a loss at this point, I see people around me being able to reach their goals (gym wise) and Im at a stand still.

- ran Creeping Death 2, for what it's worth my training have always been high-ish volume, so CD2 didn't shock me that much
- took a deload on week 8 of program, now I'm on week 11
- my daily calories is  ~1600kcal at around 532kcal deficit, 130P 54F 151C on training day, a bit lower on none training day, most carbs are around workout
- I take intra-workout that John suggested (EAAs and Cluster Dextrin) to improve recovery
- sleep has been good, sleeping 7.5-8h per day

**Symptoms**

- today's leg day was the easiest leg day in the entire program so far but it was the first time I felt like I didn't want to complete the workout, I just felt so tired physically and mentally. I pushed through and completed the workout nonetheless
- low energy/motivation throughout the day
- food craving/hunger increased, although it's still controllable
- low libido, low erection quality, watery semen (my libido isn't crazy to begin with, but it's noticeably worse now)

**If you train hard, you need deload periods. If you can train for 2+ months without feeling accumulative fatigue you're probably not training very hard.**

There seems to be a common trend on this sub that people aren't taking deload weeks because *""bodybuilders don't take deload weeks, that's for powerlifters"" or* *""planned deloads are bad""*

Seems to be mainly because of a video from Natural Hypertrophy, this idea is unequivocally false.  
I have nothing against him specifically, but all research done on this subject points to deloads being a 10/10 amazing thing to do.  
A planned deload week with the correct build-up and progressive overload into a peak week beforehand is fucking beatiful when you train hard. You come back more motivated, stronger and refreshed than ever. 

I don't want this to turn into a long rant so I'm going to link a few videos below that can explain this infinitely better than I ever can.

"2023-08-27",1693097072,"Is low volume extreme intensity the key to natural progress past a certain point? Are Isometrics to failure a superior alternative to dropsets?","7 years of training experience, always been sort of a high volume guy. Trained with somebody that showed me his low volume high intensity workout, finishing off a set with partials + isometric holds. I became addicted to that intensity so I incorporated on my own workouts. I've made great progress years 6 to 7 just when I thought I hit my ""peak"" long ago...  
  
The advantage compared to drop sets? You don't kill your CNS in the process, 100% muscle tension through the entire set. In case of hack squats or pendulum squats for example (where it's relatively safe to fail) you don't destroy your knee joints by reping to lower weights over and over, you don't struggle to breath, feel like dizzy or like you are about to pass out and the only thing that dies is your muscle. You just reach failure, find the tension point and hold it, when the pain becomes too much you reset, rest and repeat as much as needed.  
  
I kept my usual strength periodization, the first exercise always being a bench/squat/deadlift to 3-5 reps and overload overtime but I cut down the rest of volume even more.  
  
3-4 days PPL training with days off between (probably around 8 sets muscle/week on average legs a bit more) ONLY 1 working set per exercise, but a working set to ABSOLUTE failure. We are talking about 8-12 full range reps + partials + isometric holds until you can't keep the weight steady anymore. I would choose certain machines or exercises that makes the job easier, like unilateral rows where you can help yourself with your other hand to bring the weight up once you reach ""positive failure"".  
  
Yes I believe this is not meant for everybody as its extremely hard to endure that sort of pain (I honestly never felt such pain like doing leg extensions iso-holds to failure...) but it's just what made me gain that little motivation I lost from training, and seeing really good progress on gains, strength and resistance from only the last year alone (after being stucked for a while)  
  
I barely do drop sets or supersets anymore, they feel like a chore to me as the stimulus is much bigger with iso-holds. Also my workout is done in less than 1h which is a plus. The only downside is nobody wants to train with me anymore.  
  
  
  
Anybody who trains like this, or am I the only masochist?

Im 56 and currently 135lbs. Just made a post about recomping a couple of hours ago (if you saw it, this is a follow up to that post). It seems like my lean bulk and cut cycles arent really producing great results (if any).

I began my most recent bulk at[ 138lbs](https://i.imgur.com/S9OuJwo.jpg) in January 2023 and am currently at[ 135lbs](https://i.imgur.com/O4jIVyN.jpg) (December 2023) but I look almost the [same](https://i.imgur.com/QQQMcPT.jpg). Bulked to[ 156lbs](https://imgur.com/a/U8cDtZQ) from January to June and even hit a 225lbs bench for 3 reps but I still look the same at the end of this cut as I did before bulking. I made sure to bulk at around 2lbs per month and get anywhere from 0.8g - 1g of protein per pound of body weight and tracked all my lifts, including my accessories. I got a bit stronger but nothing else to really show for it. My lean bulks are usually just fat gain.

Here's a collage of my [entire progress since 2020](https://i.ibb.co/54c9Bdw/Total-Progress.jpg) too if needed. If it helps, heres the [workout](https://imgur.com/a/GWoewsw) I used while bulking. That link also contains an example of the diet I was using too. Just wanted to know what I was doing wrong. Thanks.

1\. That doesnt imply that the compound exercises people have been successfully using for decades are suddenly ineffective because they dont load every muscle through the longest conceivable muscle length.

2\. That doesnt imply that you cant build muscle without access to fancy equipment that allows you to place maximal tension on a muscle in its most stretched position.

3\. That doesnt necessarily imply that training through a longer range of motion or at longer muscle lengths is always superior.

4\. That doesnt imply that you should remove every exercise from your training routine that doesnt load your muscles through the longest possible muscle lengths.

5\. That doesnt imply that you should perform exercises in ways that are dangerous or painful just so you can train at slightly longer muscle lengths (for example, if your knees or hips bother you when squatting ass-to-grass, its perfectly fine to squat to parallel; if it hurts your shoulders to do really deep pec flyes, its perfectly fine to not let the dumbbells or cable handles sink quite as deep).

6\.

It was compared to how video game companies try to keep players playing the game. It was such an eye opening read that I realized some of these tactics were things I was falling under with MMOs.

It made me consider (and I likely will) quitting MMO's and any other types of games with these addictive methods. I started realizing how much free time I'll have if I do this, so I can focus more on working out, eating good, spending time with loved ones, doing house projects, etc.

I don't know if it's my age, or my new diet and exercise routine, or both, but I feel like I'm starting to see all of these negative things that kept me down physically and mentally in my 20s, and now I'm making a conscious effort to liberate myself from these habits.

Just updating the community. Managed to secure gold in my category at the WNBF heavyweight category. It was only 2 of us in the category but I was glad to present my hard work on the stage! Didn't manage to place in the overalls but I had a blast against some outstanding athletes. Lets just say I had a massive refeed on the way back home and some more when I got home># back on the grind today. Had a nasty pump I haven't felt in a while and the burst of energy feels amazing from all the carbs. Woke up vascular all over, but did appear a tad bit watery and bloated after my first meal and water. Nothing to worry about as condition seems to be coming back rapidly. Competing in classic this weekend at the NBFI. Plan for this week is to deplete carbohydrates until 2 days out and backload carbs before the show. No cutting out water or sodium, this will stay consistent for me. My body does not react well to messing with water and sodium and carb depletion right before a show. I could not get a pump in pre-judging. Had a bag of reeses cups, rice and rice cakes with jam downed with some water and lucozade all in 2 hours before overalls. Had the craziest pump up before stage and muscle were much much fuller.

I started doing fitness as a hobby in July 2022, but truly started going to gym at 2022 October. I have never used supplements like protein powder or creatine, let alone performance enchantment drugs. I was 5'5 &amp; 120 lb when I started, but now I am 5'8 and 145 lb.

My body fat is low so a high percentage of the weight I got is muscle.

The problem is, whenever I open Instagram, I see beasts that are on my age group, who started after me and have veins popping out with gigantic muscles. Whenever I go to school yard and do some pull ups on my own, huge bullies come and make fun of me, saying my arms are like chicken.

Im talking about the benefits of being stronger which translate to more muscle stimulus because your pushing more weight. For example, Im 510 and weight 200lbs. When I weighed 170lbs, it was far more difficult for me to curl 45s but at the heavier weight I can do it easily because the weight has less of an influence on my stability causing me to push less weight, and this isnt cheating because a curling movement starts at the elbow so if I am doing it strictly and not using momentum to sling the weight up, then Im applying more stimulus to the bicep by being able to use heavier weight and this is because I am fatter/weigh more.

Also I hear people say that when you are fat your joints are cushioned by the fat and allow your muscle to be more fully recruited and therefore contracted during movements. Does this not lead to more gains?

Its always fat guys in the gym that have the most muscle under there physiques in everyday life. Lean dudes seem to only exist on Reddit.

And in the course of striving to add weight and reps, the normal response is to shorten the range of motion, increase the tempo of the reps, etc. while still claiming to use ""good form.""  Not using excessive bounce/sway/body english, but changing the form ever-so-slightly.  I am thinking of tricep pushdowns, lateral raises, preacher curls, and all manner of other single joint isolation lifts where it's easy to shorten the range of motion or lose eccentric control.  T-bar row seems to be a movement heavily cheated on with body angle, short ROM, eccentric control, etc. in order to feel like Dorian Yates on the weights.

Lately I've watched several Mike Israetel/RP videos (I know, the athletes are not natural) and they have been using shockingly light weights.  Rather than big weights, the focus seems to be on various intensity techniques (pre-exhausting, long range of motion, pause in the bottom to induce stretch and reduce reflex, supersets, etc.)   In a video three days ago, a guy with a 475 bench was using 50 lb dumbbells for incline DB press (much less than you regularly see in commercial gyms).   In the [The Complete Shoulder Workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsEUJso6zk) video, an (enhanced) IFBB pro female is doing DB lateral raises and upright rows with 5 lbs dumbbells. Mike Isratel mentions that he has overhead pressed 275 for 8 reps, but only needs the 15 to 25 lbs DBs for lateral raises and that Jared Feather, the IFBB pro with him, also only uses like the 20 lb DBs.  ""She's using the 5s, don't worry about what you're using, worry about your technique"" or something like that was the quote.

This question fundamentally structures what equipment to buy.  If the amount of weight is less important than the form, then basically no one would need expansive DB racks at home, the Powerblock expansion packs up to 70 or 90 lbs per hand, etc.  Your dips or pullups would be with strict, slow form and most people would need no added weight, or maybe just a small change plate or two (and not 35s or 45s rattling underneath them, banging their knees and pulling down their hips).

I feel like if you dial up intensity and already have to deload over three series it already shows that the muscle was depleted and you can move on to another exercice.

I can go 4 to 5 times a week to the gym, so i've developped a full body split over two days in order to hit each major muscle group 2 to 3 times a week.

Pec deck or peck flys 3\*10 to failure

Cable crunch 3\*10 to failure

You will see a lot of 3\*10 to failure, it means I aim to do ten reps and fail around ten. If i dont reach failure and dont feel close enough I will continue repping and make it to failure in 12 or 15 reps and I will subsequently increase the weight to reach actual failure in ten.

If I fail before 10 I will dial down the weight accordingly in order to fail on the tenth.

"2023-10-14",1697244879,"RIR and beating the logbook is a paradox - plus more training tips for the overthinker","I want to quickly share some quick potentially niche tips to help some fellow overthinking lifters out, so they dont waste as much time as I did - this especially applies to you if youre highly analytical and like to do a lot of research on lifting to point of it being excessive (you know who you are). I find those types tend to fall into the traps Im about to mentioned. I hope this post serves as a remedy to recent over-intellectualisation of bodybuilding.

Ive been lifting for probably about 8 years. 5 of those years Ive been focusing on RIR. It was an amazing system because prior to that I had taken literally every set to failure and was constantly exhausted and plateauing and didnt have any real systems to break those plateaus.

Now Ive made a new evolutionary stage in my training where Im ready to shed the strict adherence to RIR. And Ive noticed dramatic gains since doing so.

I hadnt realised this constant adherence to RIR stopped me from pushing as hard - out of the fear of too much training or too much volume or fatigue. All valid matters, dont get me wrong - but the constant tightrope beam balancing took my focus off more important priorities. When I would do a set under my RIR, I would get discouraged and feel demotivated, and think my efforts were wasted and I wouldnt be gaining any muscle. When I did a set past my RIR, Id panick and worry the fatigue would take over on the next set and prevent optimal muscle hypertrophy. I also realise in hindsight, I would be trying to precisely calibrate my effort, slowing down even relaxing midset to ensure I didn't tip over to the point of excessive fatigue - this really hurt my ability to exhaust my muscles. Look, I'm realising that this post is getting exceedingly niche but if this applies to you, I am happy it reached its target audience. Point being, this constant yo-yoing of worries severely stunted my ability to firstly enjoy the gym, and also ironically have ""optimal"" gains.

I also realised this adherence to RIR yet simultaneous desire to ""beat the logbook"" were contradictory, and often left the gym feeling like a chore - trying to chase both goals literally was like being pulled in two impossible directions. You cannot beat the logbook until you can - think about it, you can only take on that day, what is able to be given. If you try to force an extra rep to beat the logbook, you're probably using ancillary muscles or potentially cheating a little bit and also completely violating RIR. Never force yourself to beat the logbook.

So what are my proposed remedies to this? Forget the obsessive focus on RIR, and change it to a tenuous grasp. Use the logbook as a mere guide to see if you are on track in the big picture, and don't stress about beating the logbook if you can't.

Instead - change your focus to chasing the pain during sets. I find overthinkers miss this point. They are afraid of pain because they wish to analyse it instead of feeling it. Any new sensation is an anomaly that is filtered through examination before it is able to be accepted into their body. This is instead the precise moment you want to switch gears and let go of your thinking and fall into the present moment. Embrace the pain. Don't attempt to mental gymnastics out of the pain, and really focus on feeling every fibre of your being and muscle break under the grind of the last few reps - and stay there, be patient with it, don't cop out early, when you are on the sticking point of the rep, don't let your mind go elsewhere, instead dig deeper (and perhaps imagine you're channeling your inner bro if it helps). When you feel that pain and burning building - that's perfect, feel it in its entirety, even if you feel like you are going to die, and your whole body is screaming, stay there and keep chasing it. This is the next layer of bodybuilding, building your mental to feed your physical. Plus, this awareness of your body allows you to gauge your RIR more accurately too. 

Finally - it's okay to develop your personal gym intuition. You don't have to rely on ""scientific studies"" to show you what you've been noticing session after session. The whole point of this journey is to get to know your body better, so don't neglect all the tips and evidence along the way about what works best for you. Get in tune with your body, and get out of your head.

I hope this helps.

For example, if I ask them if they squat, they say no, and say they do leg press, leg curls, leg extension to build their quads and hamstrings. They say you dont have to do squats to build massive legs. 
Same is with pull ups, they say that they havent performed a pull up in a while and rather do other isolation exercises to build their massive back muscles.

I started taking training serious in early 2000s, which was a time where the scene was going against high volume routines.  HIT was making a resurgence, and ideas like 1-3 sets per exercise, 6-8 total sets per muscle group were common.  So guys like Jeff Willet, Dante Trudel and routines inspired by Dorian influenced me the most.  I also have big admiration for Skip Hill, as he has always thought outside the box and is a really genuine guy.

They all have a train to failure, keep recovery in check and volume low approach that has always spoke and worked well for me.

I've been lifting in the gym for 8 years now. But the travel time to get to the gym is slowly not being worth it for me. It's about a 20 minute walk to the train station, then sometimes a 10-20 minute wait for the train, I get to the gym, I only have enough for 30-40 minute workouts. Then takes another 30 minutes to get back home.

So the commute can sometimes be an entire hour.

But the issue is that at my house I don't have much room. I have a foldable incline bench with dumbbells up to 60lbs. 

I'm thinking about buying an ez curl bar and buying few plates, maybe 70lbs worth/35kg, plus a pull-up/bar dip station. Don't have enough room or money for a rack. I'm not even sure a pull-up bar station would fit in my room yet.

Front relaxed from my morning physique check: [https://postimg.cc/vcnjGTs2](https://postimg.cc/vcnjGTs2)

So I really wanted to try competing again after 5 years break (yeah a long one) and here I am in my full beauty :D I am really sure some of you could remember I posted every week from my last show and kinda forget to do it right now, so maybe if you would be interested I could start doing it.

As for this prep.. I was really hyped to start and would say started pretty early at 74kg just week before New Year. After week I caught a horrible illness and lost some weight and I would say the real prep started after at like 72kg. Now I am 10 weeks in lost around 2,5kg as my average weight was around 69,5kg.

Tenth week began with very big energy drop, leg stiffness and irritability. After consulting on r/bodybuilding I realized it was time for a diet break (it was planned as well but I was just so much stubborn and did not wanted to do it, because I thought I need to lose a lot more fat).

Plans for the rest of the prep are as follows:

* finish deload and diet break
* keep calories pretty much high until like 8-9 weeks out (I would say around 3000kcal/day)
* then go back to my original losing calories (2700kcal/day) and add 8kg vest (using 5kg now)
* 3-4 weeks out I should be definitely ready and I would start getting back to maintenance and filling up my muscles

For those interested in my training and macros:

I do 5 day split ULPPL, 12-14k steps a day, most of the day I am on my feet (I have standing desk at my home and job aswell), I do bike 6 days per week to job, gym and sometimes I play beatsaber :D

Calories and macros are still same from the start of the prep and that is 2700kcal (190P, around 50F and rest are carbs).

I do wear a weighted vest and I think it really helps with the prep as I am not hungry at all and until week 10 felt really good.","naturalbodybuilding",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/11qkp54/11_weeks_out_from_my_first_official_classic/"

I feel that I never go as heavy as I possibly can in early movements because Im afraid the rest of my workout (maybe 2-3 more compound movements followed by another 2-3 isolation) will be compromised. If at the last set of my final compound movement I feel I still have energy, I might train to failure or do a drop set. 

Am I training properly or am I hindering my progress by rationing energy too conservatively?

I understand training to failure can be beneficial but I also read that its not supposed to be done for every single work out.

I often do front squats, just out of enjoyment (cue ""not optimal"") but for BB squats, it's something I know I don't really 'care' too much in terms of how much I squat and rather have chunky tree trunks. 

This had led me to a rabbit hole, where at my gym, it has the trio of: pendulum, hack squat and belt squat machines. 

I'm starting to get paralysis by analysis, as some days the machines feel great, but some days they don't. I think I have been seeing when in doubt, opt to go for the pendulum first.

"2023-10-19",1697739399,"What's the root your weightlifting passion?","I know a lot of working out is discipline. I'm no foreigner to that having been lifting for now close to 9 years. However, I'm in a bit of a rut and I realize a lot of my relationship with weight training was rooted in an unhealthy body image and extrinsic gain.

I was always the ""skinny"" kid. I hated how I looked and I wanted to prove to my friends and peers who put me down that I could be bigger. I wanted to win the gaze of women with my body. It was not the healthiest relationship with weight training and over time I had to decouple myself from this root desire. Along with that though, the root of my passion seems to have also dwindled and it's been much harder to stay disciplined over the years.

So in an effort to be inspired by more healthy mindsets I'm trying to crowdsource from this community **why** people lift. Ideally I'm looking for healthy reasons. That's what I think the essence of passion is. Passion, to me, is a response to a good desire. The greater the good, the greater the passion that's evoked in us.

"2023-01-29",1675031233,"Internally rotated shoulder/ winging scapula. Feeling helpless","I feel like everything I try is useless (including physio). My left shoulder is very internally rotated, so much that a part of my front delt is atrophied (https://imgur.com/gallery/ZRl4pfy , https://imgur.com/gallery/06cbFJu), and the scapula wings (https://imgur.com/gallery/KTGD4qd ) . I already kinda had the winging as a child (inactive + bad sitting posture). I remeber how I would show off my ""skill"" to stick out the shoulder blades.

It's demotivating. I keep getting tendon inflammations and my left arm is weak and looks weird, even if as big as the other. I stopped going to the gym for 3-4 years for this reason and just did jogging + home workouts + physio with a lot of streching and foam rolling but nothing changed, so I went back to working out. I can train, but I feel like this is going to keep getting worse. 
The feeling is as if my shoulder was internally rotated and fixed that way with screws, maybe there is someone who can relate. 

Problem advice 1: stretching. I have no mobility issues. I can easily reach the ground on db flies. I can hang forever. I used to do yoga twice a week. I think it only helps for the muscles that already are performing well, and nothing to solve the actual problme. I use full ROM on every exercise, but I feel the shoulder tries to rotate inward especially during pull movements (elbow going out instead of back) or pushdowns. On pushing movements I feel the left shoulder blade pressing against the bench. When doing the cable external rotator cuff exercise, I fatigue after very few reps with the least amount of weight. 

Problem advice 2: myofascial release/foam rolling. My muscles in upper chest, rhomboids and upper traps are so tight it feels like bone, especially the ones behind. Years of pain by pressing my back into a ball did NOTHING. I get to the knot, but it's just too hard. 

Problem advice 3: strenghtening the serratus. Scapular pushups for example. I can't do them. My scapula just sticks and contibutes to worsen the problem instead of solving it. Same with every other exercise. I try to use impeccable form, always, but at the end of the workout my shoulder always looks worse than when I started. And it's impossible to spend 100% of my day focusing on keeping my shoulder straight. And as soon as I let them go naturally, the left one they falls as low as possible. 

I have no idea what to do. Every physio tells me to do me the same exercises that I have been doing for years and that have done nothing. I hate everytime they tell me ""yeah you go to the gym and only train mirror muscles"". WRONG. I do more pulling than pushing. But how is this supposed to help, since the serratus is used when pushing? Actually, I feel like my big lats from pulling so much only pull the shoulders further down and inward. 

Anyone had the same situation, and managed to find a solution? 

About me: 25 y, 183cm, 85 kg. Played tennis as a kid (I believe the backhand movement may contibuted to the internal rotation), started working out at 15, probably doing a lot wrong, but only for 1-2 years. Already traineed like now (good form and rom priority #1) in my late teens. 
My left pec is nonexistent compared to the right, ""hole"" in the front delt, left arm is bigger (especially triceps) but way weaker. Relatively narrow shoulders,  so I guess anatomically a little winging is normal.

These comments are extremely unhelpful and dont provide any insight whatsoever. Simply trying to lift more each session/week is not a viable plan and doesnt provide any long term guidance. 

What is the alternative? Following an actual structured program with planned rep schemes, careful ordering of exercises, target weights over the course of a cycle, and contingency plans for plateaus or failed lifts.

**Even with the newly found attention brought to calves**, I still think it's massively undertrained for everyone (including myself honestly). Been 8 months in the new gym, and I haven't seen anyone touch the calves machine or do calves with leg press/barbell/smith.

Arguments for calves:

Deceptively [large](https://themusclephd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Muscle-Volume-Chart-2.png), the gastroc+soleus combined is larger in volume (cubic cm) than any upper body muscle group, larger than hamstrings, very slightly larger than the glutes!

Prominent aesthetically. If you wear shorts, the calves are completely exposed compared to any other muscle group, similar to the forearms. (Unless you go out shirtless/pantless all the time)

Building on the previous point, I often see people getting the chicken legs [label](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/nm0pvz/chris_hemsworths_legs_look_like_hes_getting_ready/) from small calves, and not really quads/hams/glutes. This is anecdotal of course and small legs overall will probably make things worse.

I often see arguments against calves training as a resignation to genetics (i.e. people born with insane calves don't need to train them), but imo this is a misconception, even with bad calves genetics, training them will make them stronger and larger, so why not? Maybe I'm missing something here.

Always focused on compound lifts and ignored isolations because I was told weighted chin ups and bench will grow my arms nonetheless. Anyway, my arms grew from 12 to 14inch and stayed at that size forever. 

  Moreover, whenever I tried to train arms intensely they would pump up and fatigue too quickly. Like 4 sets of bis and tris and they are pumped and rock hard. I couldn't seem to train them anymore that day since I would start losing pump gradually.

 So I started a bulk last year and added around 12 sets of bis and tris with it. I bulked upto 188 lbs with no noticeable improvement on my arms. So I cut back slowly to 171lbs (still continue the 12 sets of bis abd trus) now with arms hovering around 14.6inch.  my long head of tricep is non existent and bicep is flat af although I have a 3 inch gap between elbow and bicep. 

Adding my back, chest and shoulder pic as well so that you guys can review and let me know If I really need to bulk up more just to grow my arms. Or Do i need to do anything else?

**Fifth, its not entirely obvious that creatine supplementation did actually increase serum DHT levels.** &

**So, did creatine actually increase DHT levels relative to placebo, or is this finding merely a false positive, driven by randomly low baseline DHT levels in the creatine condition (which couldnt be caused by creatine supplementation), and random (non-significant) decreases in DHT levels in the placebo condition (which also couldnt be caused by creatine supplementation)?**

The real kicker:

**In short, serum DHT levels  the levels of DHT in your blood  arent predictive of hair loss, and arent important for hair loss. Rather, the DHT that causes hair loss is the DHT produced in your hair follicles themselves.** &

**Lets circle back to creatine now. Theres a single study potentially showing that creatine increases serum DHT levels, and thats it.

I'm not sure if I could get a dip and/or a pull-up bar but I might be able to, soon) please if you have any exercise recommendations please list them (even just one)

- Dumbbells (A pair of 7 lbs and some 2 lbs that my sisters used before but they've kinda ghosted it lol)
- A band 
- Uhh some backpacks I suppose I could fill with books

-Of course some chairs as well, yes
-A flat bench 

I tried to switch to calisthenics, Even doing it gradually by switching other exercises that target the same muscle groups but = I suppose I'm choosing the wrong ones so I end up hating it and switching back to doing incredibly high rep work with either my bands or my dumbbells (not my backpack because I get a lecture about the bag not being able to cope with the weight I put in it) ; I promise to be more careful with the bag when you guys give me bag-exercise recommendations tho

I occasionaly CAN go to the gym when my parents aren't home (tho I have to shorten my workout) but that's only like..3-4 times a month, even less sometimes. 

I also hate push ups and prefer lifting, but I suppose I can stay disciplined in do it + keep it minimal(as in, if It's possible to do it only twice or thrice for separate muscle groups I AM WILLING instead of removing it completely in my training like I always do.

I started out with an upper / lower / PPL split 5 days a week that worked great for ~6 months of newbie gains and then plateaued. Im 42, tend to go all out to failure most sets, and because of that was getting pretty run down, especially doing Tuesday squats / deadlifts after a huge leg hypertrophy day on Saturday. 

I switched to a high volume 5 day bro split and growth and progression has completely taken off. Part of this is no doubt due to a novel stimulus, but I think there are other factors at play. This is what I think is going on:

The three things you need to achieve growth are a calorie surplus, a sufficient stimulus, and sufficient recovery. Since the first is unrelated to the split youre running Ill leave it aside. For the other two, you are guaranteed to achieve those in a bro split. If you annihilate 1-2 muscle groups with twenty sets, they are going to be stimulated. If you wait a week to work them out again, they are going to be recovered. 

Now, is this fully optimized? Probably not. Is there some junk volume in some of those sets? Undoubtedly. Are some muscles recovered enough to lift after 4-6 days instead of 7? For sure. But with the ULPPL I wasnt sure I was getting great hypertrophy stimulus on the strength-focused U/L days, and wasnt sure I was fully recovered at times either. The bro split has gotten me, if not optimized, probably 80% of the way there. Its effective and idiot-proof, which is great for an older newb. Its also taught me the pace at which different muscles recover, which will be really helpful when I change the split again at some point. Plus its just fun as hell. I imagine Ill work in some bro splits for the rest of my lifting days.

My point is that I hope the newbies out there won't forget that this is a highly individual journey and that you should try to find what works for YOU.

Ive been on reddit since about 2011. I remember the reddit opinions and general advice back then.  At the time, people were very supportive pf Mark Rippetoe and Starting Strength. They believed and pushed the view that naturals just need low volume and to focus on strength to gain their size. Training like bros and with high volume was not necessary and a waste of time.
The prevailing view back then was also that protein required was 1 gram per kilo of bodyweight, and more was a waste.

However for all the bad(i used to get downvoted heavily for saying the above views were crap and starting strength sucked), there was a better understanding of novice/intermediate/advanced training imo.

Then suddenly everyone hated on rippetoe and Starting Strength volume got trendy even for those who dont need it much. I think some programs like greyskull or nsuns got really popular, and they were actually better than starting strength.

Next we come to now where its pushed hard for novices to train like intermediates/advanced, and for intermediates too. We have volume and super volume to the point its not necessary for most lifters yet(seriously? WHY are people with under 5 years lofting worrying about how each rep felt and doing mesocycles and periodisation???NOT relevant for them yet), studies that proved more protein is actually better, more in line of the decades old advice of 1g/lb of bodyweight.

I could go on.

Where am I going with this? Basically things are fickle and very prone to trendy even despite people pretending its all science and studies based. Things change fast. Do not guide and base your knowledge from reddit alone and popular youtubers like the current super trend isratel guy who is causing over complicated lifting for most people where its not relevant.

In a few years it will change again! Lots of people got sucked into the train low volume and for strength, lower protein, its enough! Science! Attitudes years ago and wasted time and gains they didnt need to. Veterans will remember advising people against it and being downvoted or argued with, while many may have experienced the suboptimal approach directly and learning from it.

I feel them in my quads, glutes, hips and hamstrings.  I feel that they work my legs overall better than squats while at the same time being less taxing on my central nervous system.

Very high volume prisoner style training builds muscle. Conventional bodybuilding mid volume builds muscle. Low volume HIT training builds muscle.

The science we have literally supports all types of theories. No one has successfully disproven Mentzers HIT training, nor did the HIT crowd ever disprove regular or higher volumes. Heck, we have dudes in prisons who train like 2 times a day to failure on bodyweight who eat dogshit macros who build muscle!

Every single scientific study supports all these typical models of training in some way.

Dr. M. Isreatel made a vid on HIT and does not prove it wrong, he just critiqued it - but in no way does the science say it does not work, every critique he had of HIT can be solved by literally just reading Mentzer and the science.

The main criticism is ""what is so special about 1 set, why not 2?"" yeah Mentzer addressed this - and he mentioned that people are fixating way too much on the 1 set idea when that is tertiary to his other points. 

Plus, you do not have to follow exactly what the guy said - i could recover fast so i just workout more frequently - i learnt from the guy and applied it to my own training instead of just thinking i was not allowed to deviate from exactly what he said.... which is common fucking sense to do.

If you have never tried HIT training, then your opinion on it is irrelevant on, so can you please not just be ignorant and be like ""no it does not work because mike did meth"". Likewise with higher volume training like GVT. This sub is meant to be full of productive convos and helping each other - not a bunch of broscientists who are never open to trying new things.

For the first time in a long time i got excited to lift due to trying Mentzer and Yates style of training and everywhere i go people are like ""omg that doesn't work you are in a cult now, no science supports it"" Literally bullshit. 

If anyone has any actual evidence that outright debunks HIT then please send it to me, because as far as i can tell it seems to be supported when you actually understand what it is. this does not debunk mid or higher volumes btw - the science seems to suggest they all work so it becomes a question of preference and efficacy for each individual. You can find great studies on everything relevant by looking at everything in the videos of; house of hypertrophy, Jeff Nippard, Isreatel, GVS, etc (i am listing these as this is the easiest way to provide access to studies - especially HOH which directly provides studies follow up on)... Every study i have looked at that is often cited for most things in bodybuilding also support HIT

On the other end of the spectrum we see prisoner style high frequency and volume going to failure everyday working also - why do people accept this but not HIT? Surely if you can accept prisoner style workouts then why not HIT?

You guys talk about Dogmatic cult like behaviour but when i look at the science and try to openly talk about this stuff i just get this same cult like ignorant responses... i do not understand the problem with these differing approaches.

Use ANKLE WEIGHTS!!!

Usually every gym has a few of them. Just grab a pair that's light enough to do small increments and them wrap them on your wrists. 

Even better, you can buy 1lbs ankle weights and carry them in your gym bag, this way you can make small jumps on things like bicep curls and lateral raises.

You can even use the small ankle weights as plates. 

Your gym doesn't have small plates? No problem, just wrap the ankle weights around the barbell.

You can also use them to micro load plate loaded machines, just wrap it around the cable and let it sit on the plates.

You'll look weird using this method but it works very well, specially if you are doing dumbbell rows.

"2023-04-20",1681991285,"Powerlifting vs. Hypertrophy training. How does it build 'different' muscles?","It is commonly said that 

* lower rep ranges (1-5) is more of a powerlifting style and builds strength
* higher rep ranges (8-12) are better for hypertrophy

I'm curious how to these different styles build muscle differently.

For example, there is a professional power lifter on YT called ANATOLY. He looks 'small' when wearing clothes so you wouldn't automatically think he was strong. However, he is absurdly strong and outlifts any guy in a gym, even if they have visibly larger muscles.

How does this work exactly? Are powerlifters muscles denser somehow? Either way, the muscle fibres must be torn in order to be repaired via protein synthesis. However, clearly these different types of training have different effects on muscles size and strength.

Do different rep ranges tear the muscle fibres *differently* or is there something I'm missing?

My name is Jordan Martenstyn and I'm a PhD student at The University of Sydney conducting research on Muscle Dysmorphia (you might've also heard it called Bigorexia or Body Dysmorphia).

**I'm posting on** r/naturalbodybuilding **(with mod permission) to let you know that you may be eligible to participate in the first ever clinical trial for Muscle Dysmorphia.**

**We're running an 8-week online (all via Zoom) group Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) program for adults with Muscle Dysmorphia.** The program is completely free for all participants.

\* ***Due to ethics requirements, the trial is currently limited to people living in Australia.***

\* Please also note that you do ***NOT*** need a pre-existing diagnosis of Muscle Dysmorphia to participate.

What we know from past research is that people with Muscle Dysmorphia are at greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, OCD, and suicidal ideation. People with Muscle Dysmorphia also report much lower quality-of-life than people from the general population.

***Despite these risks, there hasn't been a single treatment program developed for people with Muscle Dysmorphia*** ... For some context, there are 200+ treatment studies published on Anorexia Nervosa.

I've listed below some common (but not all) indicators of Muscle Dysmorphia in case you think you might be eligible for the study:

* You wish that you were bigger and more muscular, and the fact that you are not as big and muscular as you would like has a major negative impact on your mood.
* When you go out in public, you worry a lot that people will judge you for being too small.
* You often wear baggy clothes or refuse to take your shirt off in front of other people to hide your appearance.
* You check your level of muscularity and leanness in the mirror at least several times per day.
* You lift weights 4+ times per week and frequently skip social events due to not wanting to miss a workout.
* You closely track your calorie/macronutrient intake and feel highly anxious if you are unable to meet your protein target on a given day, even if only by a small amount.

All data gathered as part of this study is ***strictly confidential*** and will not be shared with any third parties without your consent.

Your eligibility to participate will be clarified via a short assessment interview (with me) on Zoom, which will take around 30-45 minutes.

Please click the below link to learn more if you're interested in participating in the program!

More than happy to answer any questions at all you might have in the comments or via DM!

"2023-12-14",1702578644,"Cant hit my chest. Pecs are never sore no matter how hard I try.","I had this problem for the majority of my life. My triceps were much stronger than my chest and no matter what I did I couldnt hit my chest.

Ive done a few things, have started to build my chest and wanted to share with this subreddit what worked for me:

1.	`Learn how to activate your chest muscles. Start by standing in front of the mirror with your shirt off. Hold your arms out in front of you and simply push your two fists together. Watch your pec muscles. Keep releasing and reengaging the pressure between your fists. Try to keep all your other muscles relaxed, isolating your pecs. You can raise your fists above your head to activate your upper chest and lower them near your waist to activate your lower chest. Once you understand the feeling of your chest being activated you can practice flexing just your pecs by relaxing your arms and imagining moving your upper arms slightly inwards together. With practice you will be able to flex each pec individually while keeping the rest of your muscles relaxed. This mind-muscle connection will help you activate your pecs while in the gym.

2.	`Learn how to keep your shoulder blades retracted while you extend your arms. Some people naturally protrude their shoulder blades as they extend their arms in pushing motion. This takes load off of your pecs during many common workouts. While standing straight up and with your arms to your side, pinch your shoulder blade together. Hold that pinch, lift your arms up while bent, make two fists as if you were holding a barbell at your chest, then extend your arms straight out. Keep your shoulder blades pinched together through the entire motion as you retract your fists back to your chest. Repeat this press motion, keeping your shoulder blades pinched, over and over until it is very easy to do and you dont need to think about it. This form will also help target your pecs during many workout routines such as push ups, bench press and chest press.

3.	`Wide grip bench press. Setup a power rack with a flat bench in the middle. Set spotter bars at the height of your chest when laying on the flat bench. Place an empty barbell on the spotter bars and lay on the bench. Grab the barbell with a WIDE grip. When the barbell is on the spotter bars near your chest and you are grabbing the bar, your forearms should be vertical. Pinch your shoulder blades together and activate your pecs as described in step 1. You can attempt to squeeze the bar together between your two grips to be sure your chest is activating. Now lift the barbell up and drive with your pecs. Explode up with the bar to a full extension then slowly and in a controlled manner lower it down. Go really slow as the bar gets close to the spotter bars. Do this a few times without any weight as a warmup and so you get used to activating your pecs with this motion. Now load the barbell to the max you can do in about 5-10 reps and repeat until failure. Once you can no longer lift the bar off the spotter bar take a little weight off each side and do it again until failure. Do at least 50 repetitions reaching failure at several different weight amounts. If your chest has never been sore it will be sore after this.

Do this several times a week. As your chest gets stronger and you get better at using it, youll be able to incorporate different workouts to hit your chest. As you lift heavier you may want to venture away from the wide grip bench press and go back to a standard grip to avoid injury.

If a movement uses more than one joint, it by nature uses more than one muscle (even if one is the prime mover or the target muscle), and is a compound movement. 

Using a machine does not automatically make a movement isolation. For example, a leg press is still compound because you are moving your hip joint and knee joint.","naturalbodybuilding",18,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/16hqxbg/isolation_movements/"

##### Diet &amp; Nutrition
[MacroFactor data](https://imgur.com/a/500qeLN)

I started a cut from end of Feb at ~172lbs to ~158lbs at end of Apr. Then maintained for a bit and started a lean bulk at a goal rate of 0.42lbs/week. I eat pretty much the same thing everyday, track macros religiously, and make sure I hit my macro goals everyday.
I follow a balanced diet plan by MacroFactor. Right now the macros are 141g protein, 75g fat, and 253g carbs for a total of 2261 calories a day.
I don't do drugs nor alcohol.

##### Supplementation
Creatine, protein powder, fish oil, and Vit D. Nothing crazy.

##### Training
I definitely put in the effort, pretty much always going to 0-1 RIR. I really don't think intensity is the problem here. I also control the eccentric, don't do cheat reps or ego lift, etc. Volume is on the higher end in general.

##### Recovery
I get 7.5-8hrs sleep everyday. No high stress (same or below 2022 levels). Sedentary outside the gym. I seldom feel weak or lethargic in the gym. I also have intra-workout shakes (cluster dextrin and EAAs, as prescribed by John Meadows).

##### My guesses as to what's wrong
**Volume**: I'm a recovering volume junkie, and while high volume worked well in my noob gain phase, perhaps it's not doing me any good now.

**Strength progression**: I'm not sure if this is a symptom or cause, but my strength (at least on the big 3) peaked at around the end of 2020 when I was eating like a pig and following GZCLP. And in general, I'm very weak for my size. Last time I did bench, I did 165x9, 165x7, 155x8... At my peak I did 200x5 which is not that impressive to begin with. And just in general for all exercises, I find it very hard to progress on strength. Usually when I start a new routine/exercise, I can make some initial progress, but then I just hit a wall and can't progress further on the numbers.

**Bloodwork**: I haven't done any recent bloodwork but previously when I did them, my T results were on the lower end, I think range was like 2xx-9xx and I was in the 3xx-4xx the few times when I did them, which is not ideal considering I should be at my peak T level around now, and all the factors like sleep, stress, diet are all dialed in. I do have some low T symptoms but they weren't severe enough to affect my daily life or gym progress so I didn't bother with TRT or whatever. But maybe now it's a good time to look deeper into it.

Hopefully I provided enough information, if not, let me know and I can provide more details. After this revelation yesterday, I lost a lot of motivation and find it hard to wake up at 5:30am everyday to go to the gym before work. Any help is appreciated, thank you.

edit: People are saying my legs are bigger but when I compare my thigh measurements from a year back to now, they're actually smaller now (56-57.4cm vs 56-56.5cm now). I think it could be lighting, the different boxer I had on, or maybe I was flexing in one and not the other, I'm really not sure.
Another thing that's for sure is that my arm had absolutely no growth.","naturalbodybuilding",167,"https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/18jvmuj/made_absolutely_no_progress_in_the_past_year_when/"

"2023-07-02",1688316182,"|Progress|M25|6'1""|194lb-164lb|This is the most I've ever cut and it was so worth it","Hello /r/naturalbodybuilding

This is the first time I've ever posted here but I've posted my progress on reddit before. This time around, it's the most I've ever cut and I think the most successful I've been so far, so here's my write-up for what I did to achieve this. 

Progress Pics:


[January 2023 @ 194lb](https://ibb.co/zZvHtpX)

[July 2023 @ 164lb](https://ibb.co/Mp7rHGz)

-----------------------

Diet:

I used Jeff Nippard's MacroFactor app for the first few months of the year. I think this app is leagues above MyFitnessPal at this point, and is much cheaper for the premium subscription (I think less than $10 a month). The way it coaches you and modifies your diet based on your expenditure is incredible, and I had a really good idea of my TDEE all year as well as a nice weight trend graph that reminded me to ""trust the process"" even if my scale weight went up over a few days, since the weight trend is overall down on the year. 

From January-May I logged everything I ate, and went from 2700 calories/day to start the year to 2200/day by the time I reached 180lbs at the beginning of May. At this point, a trainer I know from the UK started accepting clients for an '8-week summer challenge,' which I was very interested in. This guy helped my aunt and uncle lose a lot of weight before, he seemed legit from the success stories on his profile so I said ""why not, I'll give it a try.""

I had never worked with a personal trainer before and I can say with certainty that this is something I would do again. The program he gave me was solid (which I will describe in more detail below) and allowed me to go from 180lb to 164lb in 8 weeks. It included a weightlifting routine as well as a diet program.

The diet on that program is as follows:

2000 calories on days you lift (4x a week), 1700 calories on off days (3x a week), and try to eat 140-150g of protein a day. Simple enoguh right?

Here's an example 1700 calorie day of eating for me:

Breakfast:

Coffee with Oat Milk (40 calories)

Lunch:

2 scoops soy protein powder, 1 cup berries, 1/2 cup egg white, 1/3 cup oatmeal blended with water [460 cal, 65g protein, 5g fat, 38g carb]

Dinner:

90% lean Turkey patty x2, American cheese slice x2 burger bun, mayo + ketchup + mustard, lettuce + tomato + onion + pickle [850 cal, 61g protein, 47g fat, 80g carb]

Snacks:

170g 0% Greek yogurt, 50g kashi berry crunch [300 cal, 27g protein, 5g fat, 42g carb]

Soy protein powder in water [110 cal, 24g protein]

Total: 1700 cals, 176g protein, 57g fat, 123g carbs for the whole day. There is lots of flexibility within this diet, too.


--------------------

Training:

From Jan-May I had a lot more energy so I was able to run nSuns 5/3/1 5-day routine, [links to those spreadsheets can be found here](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/). I was able to increase my bench from 225x3 to 255x3, but as I started decreasing my calories even more with my trainer, my strength went with it, so I tried to just focus on maintaining strength after I started working with him, and didn't mind some strength loss.

My trainer's 4-day routine basically consisted of 1 day each Upper, Lower, Push, and Pull, with the main lifts programmed in as well as accessories for arms, shoulders, and back on their respective days. I wouldn't spend more than an hour in the gym on this routine.

On the 3 ""off days"" (1700 calorie days), I also did an ab circuit consisting of 4 ab exercises done in 3 circuits with a minute rest in between, this never took more than 20 minutes.

In addition to lifting, I also tried to get at least 8000-10000 steps a day and tracked all this with my Apple Watch to get an idea of the amount of calories I'd burn a day. Usually my watch told me I burned anywhere from 700 - 1200 calories a day just by exercise and passive movement.

Right now as my lifts stand: Front Squat: 225x1, OHP: 135x3, Bench: 225x3, DL: 275x1 (weak I know, I basically stopped training heavy deads a few months ago but I will again soon)

_______
Conclusions:

I didn't think I had 30lbs in me to lose, I originally targeted 175 as a goal but wasn't fully satisfied with my physique, and I'm glad I was able to have my trainer's help to push me through. 

Going out to eat wasn't as hard to fit into my diet as I thought, if I knew I was going out I would just only eat my shake and some coffee to start the day, then by dinner time I was famished so I ate a big meal to fill out the rest of the 1200 calories I had left. Or if I was already near my limit for the day, I would just order a salad with some grilled chicken on it and a low-calorie vinegar dressing (not oil). I also tried to avoid alcohol as much as I could, and if I did drink it would just be tequila + soda.

I did have some cheat days sprinkled throughout this journey, and I went on a few business trips + vacations throughout the year too in which I was more lax with my diet on some days, but still tried to stick as closely as I could to what MacroFactor told me. I knew that if I just ate at my maintenance I wouldn't gain any weight on the day so having an idea of my TDEE was crucial.

Overall I'm really happy with my progress and proud of myself for sticking to it! I feel so much better being this much lighter, and I can't wait to start building more muscle. I'm switching to Layne Norton's PHAT this week, which should be a great way to get back into lifting heavy.

Obviously annoyed that I won't be able to play for a while, but it has been a really good lesson for me. I realise that a big part of why I train has to be about maintenance - I know that if I had done more RDLs, more squats, if I had just approached the training of my legs with the same attention as the rest of me, then it is unlikely I would have this injury.

**Workout Plan**
So I started a new workout program 3 weeks ago.  Its the Male Body Physique template from Renaissance Periodization.  The program increase and decreases the amount of sets you do for each workout based on how you rate the workouts.  You rate the workouts based on how sore you were from the last time you worked those muscle and how good of a pump you got, and based on that it increases/decreases sets you do the next time you work these muscle.  2 and 1 will increase sets, 0 will keep them the safe, -1 and -2 will decrease the sets.  The idea is to reach your Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV).  Also the amount of reps you do is based on how many reps in reserve (RIR) you have.  So weeks 1-2 you go until 3RIR, weeks 2-3 until 2RIR, and weeks 4-6 until 1RIR.  Week 7 is a deload.  The you start the cycle again.  So the amount of sets Im showing here are for this week (week 4) of the program, and I expect the sets to stay around this number as Im starting to rate the workouts as 0s.  The weight increases by 2.5% each week.

**What Ive tried**

Ive been seriously trying to gain muscle for the past year, with not much success.  I check whether I have gained muscle by measuring my arm circumference (in the same position at the same time of day).  I have been at 13 6/8in - 13 7/8in for the past few months.  The only time since I started measuring myself I saw any significant gain was back in September-October.  I went from about 13 6/8in - 14 3/8in in about 5-6 weeks.  The issue with that timeframe was I was eating something crazy like 4500 calories a day and I gained about 15 pounds in those 5-6 weeks, and it was mostly fat.  Then when I cut I lost 7-8 pounds but I also went back down in arm circumference to 13 6/8in, which makes me skeptical it was muscle gains.  My cut was about 7 weeks.  Ive gotten my blood tested to make sure theres nothing wrong and everything was within normal ranges.  The only thing was that one of of the markers was on the really low end of normal, which indicated I have a really active thyroid (if the marker was below normal range it would point to an overactive thyroid).  Which makes sense because I was extremely skinny as a kid.  I suspect this means its harder for me to gain muscle. 

**My plan moving forward**

Since its only been three weeks of the new program Im gonna keep at it.  I thought I gained an 1/8in of arm circumference but it might have gone back down.  Im not really sure.  It will be more clear if Im making gains in a few more weeks.  Im hoping that my body just needs to adjust to the new program.  

Im rating the workouts honestly.  I have been really focusing on form and mind muscle connection to ensure that Im hitting my target muscles.  I try to get 8 hours of sleep every night, I generally get 7-8.  I try to meditate multiple times a week to manage stress.  I havent really been drinking alcohol.  Maybe 1-2 occasional drinks on the weekend.  If Im not seeing progress Im thinking of increasing my calories.  I currently weigh myself every day.  The thing is it seems as though I have gained about 1-2 lb over the past 3-4 weeks.  My weight fluctuates, even though I weigh myself in the morning before any food or water and after peeing, so its hard to tell.  This makes me wonder whether its my diet or not.  I want to avoid gaining unnecessary fat.  I am aware that I will gain fat, thats fine.  I just want to make sure Im not just gaining a bunch of fat instead of muscle.  Like when I gained 15 pounds, that was mostly fat I think. And I dont have much muscle gain to show for it.  

**Advice I need**

Just looking for any pointers.  Any critiques of my program, diet, mindset, expectations, or anything else.  Any suggestions on what to do if I dont see progress.  Anything that could be hindering me which I havent thought of.  Any naturally skinny guys out there who had a hard time building muscle who overcame it?  In how long should I expect to see progress from this workout program?  I really want to build more muscle.  I am dedicated to it.  But it is becoming very hard to stay positive and motivated when Im trying so hard and not seeing results.  Any advice is highly appreciated, thank you!

EDIT:

For reference here is a photo of me in my underwear:  https://imgur.io/a/4nmCTq5

Let me know if this is 20-25% BF.  

I want to thank everyone for the answers and feedback they gave.  More is highly welcome too!  Based on the feedback my current plan is to increase the weights on the workouts, decrease the sets, and go to total failure.  I will try to take a video of me going to failure on each workout and post here for form feedback and on whether I have a good definition/idea of failure.  I also might switch some of my protein and fat out for more carbs.  I have 3 weeks left on the first cycle of this program, so I will finish that out with higher weights, lower sets, and at failure.  Then I will reassess.  If Im not making progress I will consider doing a 5/3/1 template (likely 5/3/1 BBB).  Let me know what you think of this. 

Also someone mentioned that I may he a hard gainer.  So if theres any hard gainers or people with thyroid issue out there please let me know your experience and if there were tests you got done to determine this.  Note, I am not looking for an excuse.  I want to gain muscle.  I dont want to be a hard gainer.  I would much prefer it if Im just an idiot who is doing a bunch of things wrong.

""I train 5x a week, but I have to travel one day in the week to a super important business meeting, and unfortunatelly my hotel doesn't have a gym and I would have to skip an ENTIRE TRAINING DAY for this hobby of mine."" Like, you do realize that you can break a week of training, mix together two days into one, even skip a week or so for fudge sake, it doesn't matter, you will not shrink, it's only a day in a week.

Just saw a post about a guy that wanted to know if it's plausable to do legs before upper in a ULUL split, since he will have to do mountain stuff and thinks that doing LULU would be better for that specific occasion. Again, don't want to be rude to the guy, it doesn't matter. The only reason that people do ULUL is that the first workout after the rest day is the one that you have the most energy, and is the ""priority"". But, then again, it's only for a week, hell, do it for a month, you will not see a difference in energy because it's still only 2 straight days of working out. In a year, it might matter, since leg workouts generally have some lower back action, and that might reduce \*a bit\* of intensity in the upper day, so doing it after the upper day would be smart. But it's only a week, dude. It's fine. It's not even your work.

Another example. You go to your grandma's house, and she made a delicious but not healthy at all dessert. Will you not eat it because ""my macros"" or whatever bullshit reason you think you have? It's your grandma, you are going to visit her in a month or so (maybe even less), she made it with such care, thinking that people will love it (and, granted, you know it tastes good).

&gt;Researchers asked 160 trained subjects what load theyd normally use to perform sets of 10 reps on the bench press. Then, the researchers had the subjects complete a set to failure with their self-selected load. On average, subjects completed 16 reps, and more than a quarter completed at least 19 reps. Notably, 76% of subjects reported that their primary goal was hypertrophy, and 80% reported that they generally performed bench press as the first exercise in their training sessions (meaning they didnt select relatively light loads because they typically train bench press when theyre already fatigued). So, it appeared that many of the participants self-selected loads that were likely too light for their primary goal. While you dont need to go to failure to maximize hypertrophy, youre probably leaving a lot of muscle growth on the table when you habitually train with &gt;5 reps in reserve (and youre certainly leaving a lot of muscle growth on the table if you do most of your training with &gt;9 reps in reserve).

"2023-02-10",1676045510,"The reason why the bro split is underrated and actually pretty damn good.","I've asked myself why bro splits are so popular when they are provebly less optimal for building muscle, and the reason I've found has convinced me that it might even be superior in getting people jacked. 

The common bro split (chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms) isn't the scientifically fastest method of building muscle when compared to 2X+ per week splits, but don't diss the bros too quickly because of that. The biggest factor to reaching ones potential isn't the rate of progress, it's continued progress.

Frequency studies don't measure adherence, which at the end of the day (or years of lifting) is more important than 15% or even 50% faster results. Hypertrophy studies are generally controlled experiments for finding out how to optimize training _given_ adherence to it, and not for example cohort studies to find out what jacked people actually did to get jacked; What style of training becomes a long time habit most easily. Anecdotally, it's the bro split. 

It would be more interesting at this point for a study to investigate why there are so many jacked gym bros doing the bro split compared to smaller gym goers doing more scientifically optimal routines. And I think they would find adherence to be the biggest factor, and I also think an inherent resistance to stagnation is a big one as well.

Reasons:

Psychologically:
- Daily (weekdays), best habit forming schedule. 
- No recovery reason to ""feel"" and take a day off when it's been a week since last time.
- Taking a day off when you are at the low end of effective frequency already feels extra bad.
- Psychologically easy to get in the gym if it's only to workout one body part.
- Looking forward to training each bodypart because it's a week since last time it got direct attention.
- Fun to go all out.
- No dedicated deload week required, no alluring taste of the lazy life.

Physiologically:
- Works forever, not prone to stagnation, built in deload every week keeps training sensitivity up, while facilitating maximal stimulus each session. 
- Works better and better relative to other methods as you advance (from a meta analysis).
- Much less fatiguing on a systemic level (except leg day, but even that is not as fatiguing as alternatives), no laying sprawled out on the floor if intensity got out of hand that day. More productive when not at the gym.
- More forgiving nutritionally, at least for building. Less body parts thirsting for nutrients at the same time, and to the degree there is overlap, one body part is prioritized at a time.    

The pros of bro splits are features that make it easy to stick to and get reliable results from. If you are easily able to stick to a more gain-rate-optimal training frequency year after year then even better, but the split that could get most people hooked and therefore jacked may actually be the bro split, and that's why it's underrated in my opinion.

An hour of extra sleep that brings you from sleeping two hours less than you need, to one less than you need is unreal powerful and comparable to taking anabolic drugs.

Men who routinely sleep 5 hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior. -Matthew Walker

After watching a couple vids by the sleep researcher Matthew Walker, hearing this really puts into perspective how important every single hour of sleep is. 

To loosely quote Matthew Walker: Within the 7-9 hours of sleep that all adult humans require, if any part/stage of it were not necessary, Mother Nature would have gotten rid of it. If a portion of our sleep could have been cut off, natural selection would have cut it off, the benefit of spending a third of our days unawake is not immediately apparent but the mere fact that we do sleep that long shows its vital importance. We are the only species on earth that purposefully sleeps less than we need to. Even consistently sleeping 6 hours a night comes with measurable/observable detriments to your health. 

Say you were doing a set of 8 reps close to failure. You wouldnt think you could skip any reps of that set and expect the best result.

"2023-11-22",1700684361,"1 year of natural bodybuilding progress.","Hey guys,

  
1 year of progress here. No creatine or protein shakes here or other supplements. Just diet and hard work. Here is my progress after 1 year and 2 months. I started at the beginning of september 2022. It was a hell of a journey. 

  
I will be honest with you, the first 4 months I didn't take gym very seriously, and was training only 1 time per week. After that, I decided that enough is enough and it is about time to stop wasting time.  If I am to do something, I will do it properly. 

  
In January 2023, I increased from 1 time per week to 3 times a week. 2 sessions of strength training (monday= chest and tri. thursday= back and biceps) and 1 session of cardio (wednesday). No legs due to an injury. 

  
In may 2023, I started training legs as well, and in total, this was raised to 4 sessions per week.

  
In july 2023 I decided I need to shred the amount of fat I gained. I was not comfortable having a big belly and a high bf. So I started doing 3 sessions of cardio per week, running outside uphill for at least 1 hour.

  
My stats are the following:

&amp;#x200B;

  
**1) Before (when I started)**  
https://imgur.com/a/bFbU5ph  
28 male, skinny fat, 1.70 cm height (5'7), 55 kg (121 lbs), depressed.

  
**2) Currently**  
https://imgur.com/a/VuUufsK  
29 male, 5'7, 62 kg (136 lbs), slightly less depressed.  


  
I will be honest, I have no idea what the fuck I am doing most of the time. Well, ok, I am not that clueless. I do understand most of the basics (I think). I focus on .  I do not count calories, the amount of protein I consume, etc. I just eat as healthy as possible with a diet full of protein. I focus on form, and if an exercise that is supposed to target a muscle group does not give me that burning sensation in that area, I ditch it.

  
My current routine is training 5 or 6 days a week. Rest on sundays or saturdays. 2 or 3 sessions of cardio per week, and 3 sessions of strength training per week. I usually try to hit 3 sessions of cardio a week, but sometimes I don't have time or sometimes I do need to rest.

  
My diet consists of lots of eggs, meat, yogurt, cheese, rice, potatoes, sometimes fruits, milk, sometimes salads, chicken breast, beef. I don't think I am missing something. That's it. I am not even kidding. For the past 6-7 months, my only dinner has been rice and chicken breast, constantly. I am a simple man, and I enjoy this meal even if I've eaten it every day for the past 6-7 months.  
I know that everybody's different, but I learnt an important lesson for myself during this past year. The more I train a muscle part, the bigger and stronger it gets. Some people prefer to train a muscle group once a week. I do it twice a week. I hit chest, back, biceps, and triceps twice a week. Once I started doing that, my progress went up significantly, in strength, size, and performance. I used to train each muscle part once a week, but that did not give me good results. For me, the most optimal and efficient way is to train a muscle part as frequent as possible per week, without neglecting rest. From may to november, I've doubled my strength. 

  
This was proven to me that I was right in my case, because the strength in legs increased the most, since I train them the most. I do 1 session of strength training in the gym for legs, and 3 sessions of cardio outside climbing uphill, which still stimulates the muscle better in my opinion than running on flat terrain. From may to today, I have quadrupled the strength in my legs. I know these are not impressive numbers, but in May I was barely able to squat with 5 kg plates (11 lbs) on each side, and now I and doing deep squats with 20 kg plates (44 lbs) on each side. Again, numbers are not impressive, but I am looking at the part that I have 4 times the strength now compared to 5-6 months ago, and I am proud of myself.

  
I will be honest, I am proud of myself. I got so caught in my own life that I forgot to take a break, and take a look back, to where I started. I knew I had good progress, but forgot how I looked when I started. When I saw the before picture, I was in shock. I almost teared up. I came a long way, and this gave me back the inspiration and motivation to keep grinding, since I was kinda down lately.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't trained shoulders at all, due to an old and serious injury, but I plan to start training them slowly and lightly. Any thoughts on progress, and how I can improve even more?

Just wanted to say I have been working out for nearly 2 years and I just learned the appropriate que to properly engage my lats... I feel so dumb.

Particularly for bench press, the information I always had was ""pinch your shoulders together to form a base"" kinda advice - which is true in a sense but the movement of just pinching my should blades together was wrong (just moving them backwards and together. I finally saw someone on a video explain, to rotate your shoulders in a rolling motion from the top and bring them down and back where they lock in... Completely different feeling, this is amazing and thought I might share as others may also have the same feeling.

Similarly, now that I know how properly engage the lats, I did the same movement and was able to perform better technique on my lat pulldown - also explains the lack of progress on that specific exercise. Duh.

I guess the difference is feeling like your shoulders are locked in and supported vs. mobile in ROM.

Hope someone out there sees this and learns the same lesson I did

EDIT: Thanks for others posting links to videos explaining! These are what I am talking about.

Also you can practice without doing an actual exercise, just stand up and roll your shoulders back and down - do a pushing motion in front of you like a bench or push up.

As a Strong user for \~3 years, it was an absolute game changer in tracking progression and routines. However, Strong and most other apps paywall really simple features and it never sat right with me to be paying a monthly subscription to essentially use a glorified google sheets. 

So I've spent the past couple months working on an app that essentially offers the same basic tracking and logging options as most apps out there, but the catch is it will **always be completely free**.

I've kept it super simple and especially if you migrate from Strong/Hevy the experience should feel largely the same. There's options to import and export data from Hevy and Strong, and it includes all of the features I felt were necessary such as unlimited templates, custom exercises, graphs, and more. Most importantly, **I have no intention of bloating the app with ads or blocking any feature behind a paywall ever**.

The app is currently on iOS only and I'm looking for early users to get feedback on improvements and additions I could make. Android users stay tuned as I'm planning on release in the next month once I make sure the app runs well.

If you're looking for something super simple like Strong and not bloated like a ton of apps out there, I'd really love for you to check it out. You can find the website [here](https://gymstro.app/). I'm still early in development and actively working on adding more features, and would also appreciate input on what could be changed/added. Don't hesitate to leave any questions below or shoot an email at [contact@gymstro.app](mailto:contact@gymstro.app), I'd love to get some early feedback.

"2023-03-28",1680018865,"Don't let ""good enough"" be the enemy of great","SUBOPTIMAL TRAINING MIGHT BE YOUR MOST OPTIMAL STRATEGY

When you read info about weight training, youll find a lot of comparison studies such as straight sets are superior compared to drop-sets for muscle growth or longer rest times are superior to short rest time for muscle growth.

To summarize some of the literature for weight training for optimal muscle development, you may draw some reasonable conclusions such as:

* longer rest times &gt; shorter rest times
* straight sets &gt; super-sets, drop-sets, rest-pause, myo-reps, and circuit training
* training pretty close to failure most of the time &gt; training to absolute failure or way below the failure threshold 
* moderate to high volume &gt; low volume
* having a full gym of equipment &gt; bare bones equipment or calisthenics 
* exercise X &gt; exercise Y
* training muscle groups 2x week &gt; training them 1x week

& and I would agree that these bullet points would likely deliver a better hypertrophy response in comparison as long as the trainee has no other preferences or time restricting factors. 

So I guess this post is for the people who have time restrictions or other training preferences and my message is dont let good-enough be the enemy of great. 

Most people arent anywhere near their natural genetic fitness potential and still have a lot of room to grow in a variety of training styles. Also, just because one style of training may have scientific evidence to show it is superior doesnt mean other methods are completely ineffective. Assuming an exercise routine isnt idiotic or dangerous, youll be much more likely to make progress if its something you enjoy and consistently do. 

Here are some examples where suboptimal training styles might be optimal for your needs:

* Only have 30 minutes to workout? Circuit training or supersets might be the answer.
* You have to travel for work all the time? Calisthenics and some exercise bands are better than skipping a workout completely because you dont have access to a gym. 
* Not interested in training 5 sets of calves because you are running late? Get on the machine and do a huge drop-set or myo-reps for 90 seconds. 
* People might not go pro with HIT (single-set to failure) training, but lots of people have made plenty of progress that way. 

I used to own a personal training studio in Texas. One of my trainers was having a hard time consistently training himself because he was finishing an engineering degree and training a pretty heavy load of clients. I remember talking to him one day and said something to the effect of If you dont have time to train, just run the rack on your arms before you leave the gym. Grab some 40lb dumbbells and curl them and keep going until you hit the 15s. It will only take a minute or two and at least thatll be one thing your always consistent with. Plus I knew this guy loved training arms. And guess what? His arms got bigger. So much he said his wife was taking notice. 

For me personally, I cant dedicate more than an hour in the gym. That includes warm-up and shower. Ive been selectively using myo-reps, super-sets, drop-sets, shorter rest times, etc. to get in work on muscles and movements I would otherwise have to skip.    

Anyways, sorry for the long-winded rant that could be summarized with just do what works for you. Manage your time. Consistency is king. Train as hard and long as you need to grow, but not any more than is necessary.

"2023-01-26",1674752470,"I can't push myself anymore","Long story short, I have been consistent for the better part of 4-5 years. I didn't miss days, I tracked my progress as well as my calories and I trained hard. At first I was doing it to get in shape and be more confident, but after a couple of injuries I decided to dial it down a bit and my reason for working out became strictly the health benefits. 

My issue is for the past half a year or so it felt like I've lost my reason to work out. I'm never excited about going to the gym and I always feel like I have no energy or motivation to push myself harder during a workout. Eventually I ended up taking a break because of my finals that ended up lasting for more than 4 months, and I recently started going again and it's still more or less the same. If I end up going all I'm thinking about is that I want to finish as fast as I can even if I'll just half ass the session to get it over with. Whole thing feels way more draining than it should be or ever was.

So now I'm at about 84 kilos, and the weight on my lifts has been increasing, but I'm at the point where I think I need to deload, because I'm hitting 4s and 5s on most of my lifts, and the motivation is going a bit now. Plus my body seems to respond to higher rep ranges.

I feel like its destroyed my dopamine. I used to get high AF on life just walking in the sunshine. 

What can I do to raise my dopamine again?

-	I drink lots of water
-	eat good with around 1-150g protein a day (100kg 180cm)
-	walk about an hour a day (WFH so get lazy)
-	dont have coffee or pre or alcohol
-	dont even bother with external sources of dopamine such as music
-	sleep 7 hours but need 8 for best recovery but my brain doesnt want to let me get that extra hour lol

"2023-03-20",1679317513,"I just got injured for the 3rd time and honestly feel like quitting, any advice?","Just for some background, I've been lifting on and off since I was 18, I'm in my late 20s now and have been lifting consistently for about 2+ years now on PPL routine.

Edit: Just for some context, first lower-back injury was from squatting with butt-wink without realizing it. I gave up squatting because I couldn't figure out the form no matter how much I tried, 2nd was from leg-pressing too low and my butt lifting so I reduced my ROM for it to fix it.

Last Monday I just got my 3rd lower-back injury from leg-pressing. I'll admit, this is 100% my fault... I let go of the side handles while the weight was down instead of up. I immediately felt a sharp pain in my lowerback and forcefully pushed the weight up and re-racked it.

Hours later and I couldn't walk, stand or even sit. I was bedridden for 2 days straight... Last Saturday I felt much better, could walk, stand and even bend over with some discomfort so I went back to the gym to restart my PPL ( Push day )...

That was a bad idea because during bench I somehow strained my neck. That same day I took painkillers to deal with the neck-pain and ended up puking it out and feeling the worst pain ever.

I'm honestly fucking depressed at this point. I don't know what's going on. I used to love lifting and dieting but now I'm like ""what's the fucking point, I'm gonna get injured again and feel like total shit"".

How do you stay motivated? I've always warmed up before my workout and did dynamic stretches and proper de-loading during long cuts and making sure I sleep well but man, this recent injury is just bullshit to me... I know I said it's my fault but still, thinking back, at that moment I just wanted to re-adjust my grip, wtf

I've always enjoyed looking swole and being strong but damn, being bedridden for 2 days straight traumatized me hard and googling for ""lower-back injury reddit"" made me feel worse reading all the posts from people who said they slipped their disc or had hernia and couldn't live a normal life for 1 year+ lol jesus, I don't want that...

Edit: Thank you everyone, I feel a lot better now and I'll definitely follow through on the advices given.

Last edit: You guys are great, appreciate all the inputs. I am back in the gym, lifting light and working on mobility. Started incorporating back extensions as advised, feeling almost back to normal but will take it slow over the next month or two.

I've also seen a doctor and thankfully no slipped disc or hernia, just severe pulled muscle or ligament damage. This being my 3rd injury, I'm not gonna fuck around anymore.

What I looked like at my lowest cut 145lbs

What I looked like when I bulked to 172lbs
https://imgur.com/a/OFvfoqm


38m 6' 155lbs. Lifting 3 years. Gained 0 lbs of muscle. See in pics and confirmed by body measurements and Dexa scans every 6 months. I've done 3 cuts and 2 bulks. Starting 3rd bulk now. I'm able to gain and loose weight on command with diet but only my body fat % changes. Trying to figure out what's wrong and could use help.

I've been on reddit for years and this is my first post. I have put a great deal of thought into my nutrition and exercise programming. I feel like I'm following all the major pillars and the best advice out there. I've gone down the wormhole, as you'll see. I'm athletic and coodrinated. Starter in varsity sports in high school. I'm very disciplined and focus much of my energy into achieving the goal of building muscle. I show up everyday and work out hard. It's very discouraging to see no results, while pouring tons of time and energy into this dream for years.

I'm looking to see if there is any advice or insight you could offer. Or support from someone who has gone through something similar. More details:

Lifting:

4-6x/week. 14-18 sets/muscle/per week. 0-2 RIR. Each muscle train 2x per week. 2-3 minutes rest. Tried different programs for 6 months at a time including PPL, UL, Full body, and customized. Different rep ranges from 4-6 to 12-15, but most often in the 8-12 range. Deload every 5 weeks. Always attempt progressive overload, but when you can't gain muscle, it's very tough over the long term. Feel recovered between workouts. 1RM on Deadlift 300 Squat 220 Bench 180. I've done a lot of research on programming and confident mine is solid. Even if mine isn't great, I should have still gained some muscle.

**Nutrition:**

80% whole foods. 1-1.2 g/LB protein/day. Fats 45-70 grams/day. Carbs 200-400 grams/day, depends if I'm in a cut or bulk. In a cut aim to loose 1.25lbs/week. In Lean bulk gain 0.5lb per week.

**Weight:**

I've weighed as much as 210lbs in my early 20s but was very fat. Never had more than 130lbs of Lean mass.

I've done 3 cuts and 2 bulks.

* 1st Cut I started at 190lbs-&gt;145 in 8 months. 1st Bulk from 145-&gt;162 in 8 months.
* 2nd Cut from 162-&gt;148 in 4 months.
* 2nd Bulk from 148-&gt;172 in 10 months.
* 3rd Cut from 172-&gt;152 in 5 months.
* Currently starting 3rd bulk.

**Bloodwork:**

I've had several tests. All are within average ranges. CMP normal. Thyroid normal. Testosterone is 580. Free T is 12. DHT is low 12 (I take finasteride). Estorgen 22. Cortisol 17. Vitamin D 50. B-12 450. Magnesium 2. Good libido and energy levels. I take vitamin D, Fish Oil, and Creatine daily.

**Sleep and Stress:**

Stress free job. Financially, no worries. Happy relationship. Sleep 8-10 hours a night. 

**Possible Issues (my guesses):**

* My age (38), but unlikely
* Low DHT (due to taking Finasteride).
* Low/non-responder to weight training.
* I drink alcohol on weekends but I also count those calories.
* Some kind of other hormone or nutrient imbalance.

"2024-01-05",1704476680,"Lateral Raises at the end of every workout","What do you guys think about ending each workout with some Lateral raise work? Even a few quick drop sets and/or rest-pause.  
  
Basically I love bodybuilding bro/pro splits, but I am obsessed with trying to have huge (side) delts. So I came up with this idea.  
  
My logic is 3-fold:  
  
1. It's probably the most important muscle for a bodybuilder, despite being so small. 

(At the very least, I'd argue that on a per-gram basis, it'll be the most 'valuable' thing to add, if that makes sense. Imagine adding 100g muscle to side delts, vs to your e.g. hamstrings, what that would do for your physique.)  
  
2. It's a small muscle, and doing it once per week on shoulder day seems... sub-optimal. It recovers really fast it seems.  
  
3. It's a great pump to have at the end of any workout (even legs lol). And it can be achieved in just 3-5 mins: just do a quick group of drop sets running down the rack, or do rest-pause a few sets with a lighter weight.  
  
So then on shoulder day (once a week) I'd be pushing the weight amount and progressive overload in a more standard fashion for this exercise, and otherwise I'm just ending each workout with quick 3-5 set pump work - taken to failure ofc because it's such a small muscle and it feels good to do so.  
  
Otherwise my split is something like Legs -&gt; Shoulders -&gt; Back -&gt; Chest -&gt; Arms, pretty standard.
